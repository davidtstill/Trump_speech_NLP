     "evalue": "'Thank you  Thank you  Thank you to Vice President Pence  He s a good guy  We ve done a great job together  And Merry Christmas  Michigan  Thank you  Michigan  What a victory we had in Michigan  What a victory was that  One of the greats  Was that the greatest evening  But I m thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas  the greatness of America and the glory of God  Thank you very much  And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again  Did you notice  Saying Merry Christmas  I remember when I first started this beautiful trip  this beautiful journey  I just said to the First Lady   You are so lucky  I took you on this fantastic journey  It s so much fun  They want to impeach you  They want to do worse than that   By the way  by the way  by the way  it doesn t really feel like we re being impeached  The country is doing better than ever before  We did nothing wrong  We did nothing wrong  And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we ve never had before  Nobody s ever had this kind of support  But this sacred season  our country is thriving and it s thriving truly like it has never  it has never happened before to the extent what s happening now  And by the way  your state  because of us  not because of local government  but because of us  because of the job that we ve done  Because I understand she s not fixing those potholes  That s what the word is  It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you  We don t want to do that  But she s not fixing the potholes  But Michigan s had the best year it s ever had  Best year it s ever had  And that s because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they re coming in from Japan and they re coming in from a lot of other places  Look what s happening  And you know  I don t know if you know this  but probably    years ago I was honored  I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody  whoever  I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan  Can you believe it  Long time  And that was long before I ever decided to do this  I was happy  I had a beautiful life  What the hell did I do this for  But look how we re doing  Do we love it  I love it  But anyway  I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to    years ago and I came to Michigan  He said   You re still the Man Of The Year   Thank you  Who said that  Thank you  So I came in and I remember the speech so well  I said   Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies  Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China  they build them in China  they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs  you lose your factories  the companies leave and you get nothing  Why are they lying   I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it  We ve stopped it  And you see that  And we just made the USMCA  We re getting rid of NAFTA  which I think is the worst trade deal ever  And it s very exciting  It s a great deal  It s a great deal  It s going to stop exactly what we were just talking about  It makes it very  very prohibitive  They can do it  but they ve got to pay a hell of a big price to do it  And history has proven that stops them  But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico  with Canada  Now  from the standpoint of the farmers  you know what s going on  We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada  We had attacks on dairy products       tariff  nobody talked about it  with Canada  And we had some really bad things with Mexico  We now have a wonderful deal  And if we didn t have a good deal  you know what I would have done what  What  I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it  right  That would have been it  Unfortunately the deal s been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened  And she had a lot of pressure  especially from manufacturing areas  farm areas  a lot of pressure to sign it  So here s what happens  So I get along with labor  I had a lot of union labor vote for me  tremendous amount of labor  In New York where I come from  we have a lot of unions  And that s okay  That s fine  So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed  we ll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal  And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that s okay  Whatever it takes  For seven months  it sits  They don t do anything  We give  And by the way  I spoke to the unions the day before I say   Fellows  you got to get it done   And union labor loves me and I love you too sir  I love you too sir  So we have a great deal with Mexico  with Canada  And it is true  I say it out loud because I say it to them right now  If they ever wanted to break the deal  that s okay  If somebody wants to break a deal with me  you always have to have an alternative  right  And this country  the deals we made  we did a deal with South Korea  That s great  We did a deal with Japan     billion dollar deal with Japan  It was just a little piece of a deal  Okay  That was a piece of a deal  And I said to Japan   Look  you got to make this deal or we re going to put a     tariff on the cars  And that s more money than anything we re talking about   That s all right  That s all right  That s all right  Get her out  Ger her out of here  Oh well  You re about to hear the greatest speech you ve ever heard  And that s going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot  Massive riots  Fake news  But seriously  look  look  look  they won t say it  They won t say it  because when we have protesters all in favor  they don t talk about it  but there s a slob  There s a real slob  Wait  wait a minute  She ll get hell when she gets back home with mom  But she made  Look  she screams a little bit  And you know what I like to do  Avoid them  Because I ll tell you the big problem  I could hardly hear her  What happens is all of you people go crazy  Look  look  look  and the place  Okay  so there s one disgusting person who made  Wait  wait  who made a  I wouldn t say this  but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right  Now they won t say that  the fake news  they won t say it  If one of us did that  it would be like the biggest story ever  I think it s terrible  And I ll tell you the other thing  I don t know who the security company is  but the police came up  but they want to be so politically correct so they don t grab her wrist lightly and get her out  They say   Oh  would you please come  Would you please come with me   Sure   Ma am  would you   And then she gives the guy the finger and he   Oh  Oh   You got to get a little bit stronger than that  folks  And they    Making another group of tariffs  seven and a half percent  This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal  which they want to start  but we re taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted     billion and    billion the previous year  helps the farmers  So you know what we do  out of that big check that we get  all that money flows into the treasury  Out of the big check  we gave the farmers    billion dollars and    billion for the previous year  And you know  the incredible thing  and I was with a lot of farmers  I was with a group of    farmers at the White House  You know what they said to me  I said   Don t worry about it  We re going to take care of you guys   And I used a bad word  You know what word I used  We re going to get you a subsidy  And they said this two years ago  I said   How much were you targeted for   This was the first year      billion  sir   The second year was     They were target  That s what they didn t get from China  So I said   It s all right  we re going to give you a subsidy of the same and we re going to take it out of the tariffs and we re going to have billions and billions of dollars left over   And they said   Sir  we don t want money  We just want a level playing field   I ve never seen that before  I ve never seen that before  So we will have invested in our military  since I m here  which is less than three years  Our military  by the way  in all due respect to the previous two administrations  our military was depleted  It was depleted  It was in bad shape  We had fighter jets that were    years old  We had planes that were    years  You heard where the father flew them  the grandfather flew them  and now the young son comes in  We ve got the best equipment in the world now  Spent two and a half trillion dollars  made in the USA  Two and a half trillion  We will shortly  That ll be all finished  We re going to have the greatest  Now we have the best planes  We re going to have the best ships  We re building a lot of ships now  We re building the most powerful weapons in the world  Now  we don t want to even talk about it  We never want to use them  But you know  the way we re not going to have to use them is if we have them  We re building submarines  the power of which nobody s ever seen before  Nobody s ever seen before  It s funny  we have these companies come in  I like to make good deals  You like to make good deals  That s what we do  right  So these really countries that come in  prime ministers  presidents  sometimes dictators  those we can t deal with too much   Sir  we d like to buy a nuclear submarine   I say   No thanks   I turn them all down  You have no idea how many people  But we re building some of the  They re the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind  I say mankind and womankind  They can definitely fight  They re the real deal  These guys  so good looking  I said   You could be a movie star  Go to Hollywood    No sir  I like doing what I m doing   So I said to these guys  you going to see  just like central casting  I said  I said   Fellas  how good is this plane   They said   Sir  it s great    Why    Because the enemy can t see it   That helps  Stealth  It s actually called super stealth  So I said   You mean they can t see  so you shoot at them but they can t   He said   They have no idea where we are  sir   I said   That sounds good to me   Nobody does it  Nobody can do it  We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes  we bought in a lot of great stuff  And I won t tell you the story  but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace  and one of the generals came up to me and said   Sir  don t go  Don t do it    Why    We don t have the ammunition   And I said two things  I never want to hear a President  Right  We never want to have a President hear that again  nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then  But  another thing we did  which to me is such an incredible thing to have done  It s such an honor  So our last US Armed Forces  the last branch was the Air Force  right  That was many  many decades ago  We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces  The Space Force  So I ll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else   See that Space Force  That was my baby   And you think that was easy  That s not easy  Because you have Democrats that do not like our military  They do not like our military  And we did something yesterday  because for three years I would see people that run  Incredible people  the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country  And every year they d come in and they d be looking for help  They needed help and they do need help with it and it s great and they do an incredible job  So many great schools  but they need help  And every year they d have to come and come  I got to know them actually  I said   The only bad thing is you won t see me too much anymore   Because we just provided record funding for a nation s Historically Black Colleges and Universities  And it s longterm  they re not going to have to come  So I said   Look  we could do it where we do it every year or we ll do what we have  What do you want   They said   Let us just have it   So we ll miss them  But they are great people  They ve done an incredible job  And our extraordinary jobs boom  which created another         jobs last month  and then you add the undercount from the previous two months  you re close to         jobs  And they said  if you re a business watcher which I am  I love watching business  but they said they were guessing  could be    0  could be    0  maybe     maybe      somebody said  Then the number comes out 266     with an adjustment  Remember about four months ago when we had one little period  right  We had one little period where there was a little downturn  They said   Oh  Oh  we think we re going into a recession   I said   Don t worry about it    We think we re going into a recession   They were willing to lose their wealth  They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own  what do you guys own back there  Let it go  They ll go bust  They don t care  Anything to get rid of us  Not me  us  And you know what  Then all of a sudden  and now for the last couple of weeks  we ve set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets  So  as of yesterday  we ve had     record days in the stock market now  and that s in less than three years  So when I see that I don t care because I don t  I m not allowed to have stock  I can t have stock  They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand  I agree  I can  But you know what  I ll tell you what  What I see  I see tremendous job growth because we re setting records  But you know what I also see  The    ks where people are up      they re up      they re up      I tell you the story all the time  I mean  I have people coming up to me  and a man came up  a policeman  I ve told this story  but I ve had many  so many times  but this guy in particular  because it was early and that was a year ago  That was a long time ago  Right now it s much higher than that  But he said   Sir  I want to thank you  My wife thinks I m a loser  All my life  we never did well with the    ks  with stocks  Everything I invested  I m up      sir  She thinks I m a financial genius  She s so in love with me  She so in love   He said   She said   Darling  I think you re one of the greatest investors  Why don t you do this professionally   And I don t even know what I m doing  sir  I just have all these stocks   So I just wanted to tell you  I look at a    k  who has    ks here  So that s what I see  I don t care about the rich ones  I care about everybody  I care  I care about everybody actually  Ford motor company just announced that it is investing     billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area  creating another      Michigan jobs  And that s on top of the many other investments we ve gotten from Japanese companies  car companies  and other companies  But they re all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan  And I say   Hey  go to Michigan   Sometimes they ll go south and that s okay  whatever  I want them in this country  But ideally I want to fill them up  We re doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies  Now you re back  You re back  So  you re back  Very proud of you  Very proud of you  But while we re creating jobs  fighting for Michigan workers  and achieving numbers that you ve never seen before  incredible victories for the American people are happening  The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage  You see what s going on  I ll tell you  these people are crazy  You ever hear   It s the economy  stupid   You know that was Clinton s saying  If you have a good economy  I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it  Nobody talks about it  If you re a Democrat  they say    Oh  it s the economy   If the economy s any good  And let me just tell you a little secret  If crooked Hillary would ve won  your economy would have crashed  You were going down  The regulations were taking it down  The taxes were taking it down  instead of being up     or whatever you re up  a lot  you would have been down  you would have been at less than half  It was crashing  For all those people that would say   Oh  it s the Obama   Let me tell you something  You were dying  And if you look at that first period of a couple of months  it was a disaster  but it was heading south  And as sure as you re standing  and I m sorry we couldn t get you seats  we didn t have any room  And by the way 20     people outside had to leave  You know  It s so cold outside we told them   Don t worry about a screen  go home  go home and watch   But we had  this is about a       seat arena  And I said to my people   Why so small   Are we spoiled  I watch these guys come in like Biden  he has a big rally and they get    people show up  No  it s true  I don t understand it  And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out  I m killing everybody  And they hate me  USA Today hates me  But there s a poll  we re beating everybody  But  so Biden has this rally  they ve got     seats  but only a small number of people  So you know what they do  They set up a round table  So think of these people  They come in  they think they re going to listen to the speech  they end up sitting on a round table discussing  They must ve been happy  right  We don t have enough room for round tables  I m sorry folks  No  they set up a round table but I think we re doing great  And how do you beat what we ve done  With the economy  with our great vets  with choice  You ve finally got choice  They ve been trying to get it for almost    years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  And these people back here  Your seat or stand is better  Right  But you know what  They re going to be much more famous because the cameras can t see you  They can only see them  And the other thing  the cameras  do you ever notice  I go to these stadiums 25 30     people  They never show the crowd  You know why  Because they don t want to have  If crazy Pocahontas  if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever  She s in Manhattan  You got me  And people  I mean  I could have  I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and he d get a crowd that would be just as  He s     He d get a bigger crowd  But if she has the crowd   Oh  these crowds are so big   I ve had crowds over the last couple of weeks  We went to different Pennsylvania  Florida  But I mean thousands and thousands of people can t get into these NBA arenas  right  Big arenas  And we set records at everyone because we use the floor  Thank you  I appreciate it  But we use the floor  right  The basketball court  So we set records at every arena  They never even mention the crowds  They never mention the crowds  It s sort of amazing  You know what  I don t think we ve ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator  That s a long time ago  I don t think we ve ever had an empty seat  Now what the crooked media does though  if you got like over here  look how packed it is and there s thousands outside  but I   Please go home  You re going to catch pneumonia   But here s the thing  If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom  those cameras will turn to those two seats and they ll say  Trump wasn t able to fill up the arena   I always get nervous when I see some  I know they re coming back  Nobody ever leaves our speeches  Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally  But every time I see a man get up  I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they re getting up  The baby s going crazy and they re getting up  They re going to take it  But I know they re going to be right back  And I say   Fill those two seats  I don t want them to see it   Because they ll say   Couldn t fill up the arena   These are truly dishonest people  After three years of sinister witch hunts  hoaxes  scams  tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans  Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history  Was that the greatest  Remember when they all said  remember when they all said   No  no  You can t win Michigan  You can t   Then I went  I did one in Grand Rapids  right  Grand Rapids  We had        people that night  It was one o clock in the morning  That means it was Election Day when I started speaking  Hillary  Barack Obama  Michelle Obama  and Bill Clinton  they did an emergency trip  They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o clock  They got here at prime time  They started to speak  She had     people  I got here at one o clock in the morning the next day  which is now Election Day  How many people were there         people outside  inside  It was the last speech of Michigan  And they say   Well  sir  it s very hard to win Michigan   I said   Why would it be hard   Here s the beautiful thing  Everything I told you I ve done  but much more so  I said I was going to bring car companies back  I said I was going to bring in  I just hope you people know that  I just hope you know it  But I ll never forget that night  And in all fairness to Bill Clinton  he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office  I like him  I like him  But he told  you know the way they tried to shut him out  right  Because he s a pro  He s an instinct guy  right  He s instinct  He doesn t need  Right  Because he s a pro  He s an instinct guy  right  He s instinct  He doesn t need polling companies  Who the hell wants him  You know  if you want a polling company  pick up the newspaper  The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write  They write fake polls  It s true  they write fake polls  You call them suppression polls  You read them and you get depressed  because it looks like you re doing badly  They do that  I think it s almost worse than what they write  and you can t get much worse than what they write  So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary  his very dishonest wife  Crooked Hillary  Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary  He might  Maybe he just calls her crooked  He said   Crooked  I m telling you  Crooked  I don t like what I m seeing in Michigan  I don t like what I m seeing in Wisconsin   He said   I took the trip to Wisconsin and I ll tell you what  they had those Trump Pence signs all the way to the convention area  every lawn  every loan  I don t like Wisconsin   And then he said   Oh  don t worry about it   What the hell does he know  They told him   What do you know   Remember  they shut him out at the   They didn t want him talking  He was right  I mean  I don t want to cause any problems in the family  but he was right  But he talked about Wisconsin  Then he talked about Michigan  He said   Crooked  I m telling you  Crooked  I don t like what I m seeing in Michigan  I was in Michigan and I m telling you  they had those damn signs  I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn  and two of them on the car   And he said   You horrible human being  You d better start listening to me  because you re going to get your ass whooped  And you know what happened  You know what happened  She didn t listen  fortunately  And she didn t come to Michigan enough  And she didn t come to Wisconsin  I think at all  right  Because her polling data looked good  It looked good to me  too  Every time I went there with these crowds  So we won Wisconsin  We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel   where is Ronna  Where is Ronna  Ronna  she was so horrible  I didn t know her  Ronna McDaniel  and she was so aggressive  She kept calling and said   Could you please come out to Michigan   I said   Who the hell are you   And I said   What do you mean  another trip   So anyway  I made  we had these big crowds  I made it again  Then finally I said  two weeks out  I said   Ronna  no more  We re going to win it or we re not    Okay      in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids   Sir  could you come to Michigan tonight   And I thought  I was just about finished  I went to a last great state  and I said   It s over   Now I sit back and I watch  and let s see what happens  right  But she said   Could you come to Michigan   I said  that is the most aggressive human being I ve ever met  And we did it  And we won Michigan  And the word is that we re much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in      in Michigan  You better remember when you walk into   you know  it s November  rd this time  November  rd  By the way though  that evening  that incredible evening in November  one of the biggest nights in the history of television  You never hear them say it  so I might as well  That election   and my debates   you see their debates are dying  Who wants to watch Buttigieg  Buttigieg  Buttigieg  You know that you pronounce it they say   I heard some guy saying   No  no  because it s an unpronounceable name   That s why they call him Mayor Pete  right  Mayor Pete  Mayor Pete  Mayor Pete  I ve had you up to here  Mayor Pete  No  Buttigieg is leading  How does   no  you say it this way  You say it   they call him Mayor Pete  because nobody can pronounce his last name  That s the only   people think it says   by the way  you know what  I m not going to say bad things about him  You know why  I d love him to win  I thought I knocked off Pocahontas  I did it a year too early  a year too early  I give her credit  she then started to come back  I don t think she s going to make it though  She s gasping  She s gasping for air  But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg  and they said   Here s what you do  boot edge edge   Say   Edge  like the edge of a building  Edge edge  Buttigieg  Alfred E  Newman  You got to be older to know what that means  But congressional Democrats are directly attacking     million Michigan voters who rose up in       won the state  and now the Democrats are very upset  They want to get Michigan back  They just don t know how to do it  because they didn t do a thing for Michigan  They didn t do anything for Michigan  All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places  You know  I don t know if you know it  Mexico has     of your car business  You know that  right  Not because of me  They re not moving  But Mexico has       of our car business moved to Mexico  Can you believe this  Before I got there  but that s what I used to talk about  I said  when I was honored that night  I said  How do you let this happen  How do you let all these companies leave   It used to go    it s probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president  It might be the   and I had a lot of them  Immigration  I had a lot of them  but that may be the single biggest  With today s illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment  the do nothing Democrats  and they are do nothing   all they want to do is focus on this  what they could be doing   are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter  This lawless  partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party  Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks  It s crazy  It s crazy  You know why  Because people  we have an election right down the road  I announced three months ago that I m running  right  I ll give you a little clue  I announced because I figured once I announce  they d never impeach  nobody would be so stupid  But they d been trying to impeach me from day one  They ve been trying to impeach me from before I ran  okay  Because if you remember when I ran  I went immediately to number one  never came off number one  We had center stage from day one in the debates  So we had  I don t know 14     debates  We had a total of     actually  People forgot there was one that they never talk about it  but that s okay  But we had    people  and I was center stage  And I said   Wait a minute  this is no good   I want odd numbers  because of your center stage  if you have a    that means two people are in the middle  So I said   Make it    or make it nine  or I m not showing up   And generally they did it  because we were way ahead from the beginning  But I made a lot of great friends out of that group  and many of them are good friends today  Although you wouldn t know it based on the   they say that was the meanest   that was a pretty mean primary  you got to say  Wasn t that fun  I liked it  Through their depraved actions today  Crazy Nancy Pelosi s House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame  and it really is  It s a disgrace  Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president  They think that the Washington swamp  which we believe it or not  it ain t easy  because they got so much stacked  including these guys  You know what  These guys are apart of the Democrat Party  They are a part of it  You might as well call them Democrats  You know  it s owned by Commicast  They re just as bad as CNN  or they re just as bad as MSNBC  And by the way  CNN and MSNBC  their ratings are down the tubes  It s great  I love it  I love it  But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election  That s what they think  There s never been a time like this  Think of it  you have the greatest economy in the history of the world  Other countries come to see me  all of their leaders  and they say   Sir    first thing   Sir  congratulations on your economy  We re trying to do the same thing  Congratulations  sir   And these guys don t like talking about it  And if they do  they say   Obama did it  Oh  Obama  Obama   Remember Obama said   You will never be president  He will never be president   Then remember he said   I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president   And then I became president  He wasn t so happy  And in all fairness  he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary  because he had more strength  I mean  I go to these places  Secret Service  they take me  I haven t seen a lobby in three years  It s true  I go through basements  I pass compactor plants  I know more about compactors from this job  I don t see lobbies  I say  Fellows  you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby    No  sir   But I ll tell you what  I go upstairs  downstairs  all around  They re taking me up three flights  go down one  I said   Are we almost there    Yes  sir  another four flights   And I say   You think Hillary could do this  I don t think so   They d bring her back home  She wants to go to sleep  And now I hear she wants to run again  Wouldn t that be great  Oh  Thank you  Thank you  Oh would we love that  You think the Democrats are screwed up  Wait until that happens  Wouldn t that be   Oh  there s my guy  Lock her up  Lock her up  Lock her up  Well look  based on the FBI report  you just saw what happened with the IG  where they came out with the FBI  Based on that  you know what  I never stopped you  But now  think of what they did  Think of what they did  Think of how dishonest it all was  They shouldn t even be allowed to have an impeachment  because it was based on dishonesty  It was based on illegality  She went out  and they paid for a fake dossier  They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier  totally disproven  totally fake  The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign  And if we were Democrats  they would ve been in jail two years ago  It s a disgrace  Think of what they did  So they use this fake dossier  and they brought it before this big deal court  It s a big deal  the FISA Court  And they said this stuff  and they lied about it  because Comey  who s another beauty   did I do a great job when I fired his ass  What a great job  Oh no  they had bad plans  No  I did a great thing  That was like throwing a rock at a hornet s nest  Did that place explode  And then we learned about Lisa Page  and her wonderful lover  Peter Strzok  I love you Lisa  I love you more than anybody in the world  I love you more than anybody in the world  It causes problems with the wife  but we won t talk about that  Those tapes didn t work well  No  how about those statements  right  And then they say   In all fairness    I really liked the report  but how does the Inspector General say   because don t forget  he was appointed by Obama  So I m not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets  but we had a lot of those nuggets  How does the Inspector General say  You have these horrible   he s going to lose  Isn t he  He s going to lose  or she s going to win     million   Did you see all the zeros  It was like   I m blinking  I says   I think it s        He s going to lose     to one  Isn t he Peter  I love you so much  Peter  I ve never loved anyone like you  He s going to lose     million to one  Peter  right    That s right  He s going to lose     million to one   But there s no bias  How about the insurance policy  To me  the greatest  Just in case she loses  we have an insurance policy  We re in the insurance policy right now folks  We ve been in it for three years  that s what they meant  I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator  because we re doing awfully well  And I ll tell you something  Rush Limbaugh said it  Sean Hannity said it  Laura Ingram said it  Tucker said it  Ainsley said it  but a lot of people have said it  They said   There s nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened  and still created one of the greatest economies  and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years   I understand that  I understand that  but it s my life  very unfair to my family  I have to say this very  very unfair to my family  What they put my family through is a disgrace  Me  it s my life  It s fine  I do  But you know what  What they put my family through is a disgrace  and they ought to be ashamed  and we should get apologies all over the place  So yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party s outrageous abusive power  That s what it is  They have nothing  They re the ones that should be impeached  every one of them  I mean you got this guy  Schiff  He makes up a statement  and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity  and he makes up a statement from me that s totally fictitious  totally out of thin air  The worst statement I ve ever heard  Many people saw it  I had a person two weeks ago that said   I didn t love the statement you made  I said   Really  Didn t you read the transcripts   I always say   Read the transcript  But didn t you read it   No  no  I heard it on television  I watched Adam Schiff   He made it up  I then sent him the transcript  He said   Oh  now I feel better  That s perfect   I call it perfect  He called it perfect  Everyone calls it  if you read it  But here s the thing  He makes up this statement  and it finished  Didn t he have eight quid pro quos  Eight  Could you imagine  you re dealing with a country  and you say eight times that you ve got to do something  The first time they say   Well   The second time they say   That s strange   Third time they say   What s wrong   You said eight times  Eight times  They d have you arrested  They d have you put into an insane asylum  But he actually said   I think he said eight  not seven  eight  And then he finished with   Don t call me  I ll call you   Can you imagine  The President of the United States   Don t call me  I ll call you   You know what that is  That s a mafia statement  okay  That s the head of the mafia saying   Don t call me   This guy actually said that  and then he walked away and people became incensed  because they knew that wasn t the people that read the thing  Most people believed him  He s a liar  Because you know  he s a corrupt politician        No  he s a corrupt   and then I see him  By the way  you ever see this guy  He walks up to the mics  I mean  we re not   all fairness  look  I don t want to be   because with Me Too  I never even think about looks anymore  okay  I don t talk about looks of a male or a female  but in his case  let s just say   the last time I ll ever refer to this  He s not exactly the best looking guy we ve ever seen  No  any mic  He walks up to the mic  and he s so just   This is a sad  sad day for America  Our president is an employee of Russia  I have absolute proof that the president  this is at the beginning  and every week they d say  Where s the proof    It s coming  It s coming   Then we get the Mueller report  nothing  And I ll tell you what  I know some of the people in this audience  If I spent not     million  not    Trump haters  I call them the angry Democrats  It was     then it went to     and then Mueller  Did Muller do a good job  Did he do a good job  No  Boo  How was his performance in front of Congress  Boo  Not the best  but think of this      million they spent  And you know  I heard somebody say   Well  we got back some of that money   Let me tell you  you cost this country billions  and billions  and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn t get done  in all of the embarrassment to our country  You caused billions and billions of dollars  and it was a hoax  But this guy  Schiff   I have absolute proof  I have this  I have that  this  that   Anytime he sees a camera and he s stone faced  stone faced  He s a pathological liar  He gets up  and I ve never seen anything like it  Even I was saying   I wonder what he has  What does he have   He says   I have absolute  I said  I haven t spoken to Russia in year  What the hell do I have to do with Russia   But this guy gets up   oh  I think we have a vote coming in  Haleigh  Wow  Thank you  Haleigh  great job  Wow  The Republican party has never been so affronted  but they ve never been so united as they are right now  ever  never  And I know the senators  and they re great guys  and women too  We have some great women  We have great guys  They re great people  They love this country  They re going to do the right thing  They re going to do the right thing  So I said in my letter to Pelosi   I love that  You know  usually there s one  two  The Republicans  look  I ve said it for a long time  The Democrats are lousy politicians  they really are  They ve got horrible policies  open borders  crime is fine  drugs pouring through  I mean  think of what they do  Sanctuary cities  they love sanctuary cities  They re lousy politicians  but they have one thing   two things  They are vicious  They re the most vicious people  The Republicans aren t as vicious  They may learn to be vicious after going through this  though  But the other thing  the Democrats always stick together  Now think of it  three Democrats went over to our side  no Republicans  It s unheard of  And by the way  this is for a hundred years  I m not just talking about this little point in time  The Republicans are known as  it s always harder to stick together  These people are great  We have a great Republican Party  and we have to get that change  We have to take back the house  You ll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take   and by the way  we had another victory  The individual mandate  just a little while ago  it came over the wires  it was just upheld  The individual mandate is now gone  The most unpopular part of Obamacare  It was just upheld  So I said in my letter to Pelosi   By proceeding with your invalid impeachment  you re violating your oath of office  You re breaking your allegiance to the Constitution  You re declaring open war on American democracy  You dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme  yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America s founding  and your egregious conduct   And listen though  it s so true  it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged  and in fact their very lives to build   You are the ones interfering in America s elections  You are the one subverting America s democracy  We did nothing wrong  nothing whatsoever  This was just an excuse  You are the ones that are obstructing justice  You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish  personal  political and partisan gain   They re bringing pain  The work we could be doing on lowering drug prices  on getting rid of these horrible  horrible situations  You know in the border   the woman is okay  Is she okay  Okay  thank you very much  Thank you  I mean  some of these people are waiting here for three days  right  Thank you  They ll come back  Come back  Merry Christmas  Thank you  Merry Christmas is true  But what they ve done with this perversion  it s perversion  And when you watch some of these people get up and speak today  they don t even    You have violated the Constitution    Well  what does he done wrong    Well  we don t know that   They don t even have any crime  This is the first impeachment where there s no crime  I say   Tell me what I did  please    Well  we don t know  You violated the Constitution   You had Turley  who s smart  Alan Dershowitz  these guys  All of them  they said   There s no crime  There s no crime  right  There s no crime  There s no crime  I m the first person that ever get impeached  and there s no crime  I feel guilty  You know what they call it  Impeachment light  It s impeachment light  That s why  with Richard Nixon  I just see it as a very dark era  very dark  very   oh  you don t even like to think  I don t know about you  but I m having a good time  it s crazy  But I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party  we really do  Maybe I wouldn t feel the same way  but we have a great group of people behind us  We had in the House  and we have it in the Senate  They re doing a great job  so I m not worried  I m not worried  because it s always good when you don t do anything wrong  you get impeached  That may be a record that will last forever  But you know what they have done  They ve cheapened the impeachment process  And now anybody that become   this is a sacred position  Anybody that becomes president  I mean  they could have a phone call and they get impeached  So if the Republicans   if you had a Democrat as president  we have a Republican house  they don t like the guy for whatever reason  or the woman  they impeach the person  It s cheapened it  It s exactly what our founding fathers didn t want  and they said it could happen  and it s happened  But I know one thing  Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office  But it s so disappointing  I see a woman  Carolyn Maloney  She s a long time  nothing much  believe me  She s a Congresswoman from Manhattan  the east side  I was with her  Her first race  I helped her  She was always so nice  Oh  thank you  thank you   I made lots of contributions over the years  In New York  if you re not a   it s purely Democrat  especially in Manhattan  So what happens  I make lots of contributions for years  and years  and years  I go run  The first person I see  Carolyn Maloney  I raise my hand to impeach  Well  give me back the damn money that I ve been paying her for so many years  Let her pay me back all the money  Let her pay me back all the money  Then you have this Dingell  Dingell  you know Dingell  from Michigan  You know Dingell  You ever hear of her  Michigan  Debbie Dingell  that s a real beauty  So she calls me up like eight months ago  Her husband was here a long time  but I didn t give him the B treatment  I didn t give him the C or the D  I could ve  Nobody what is  you know  I gave the A  treatment   Take down the flags    While you re taking them down for ex Congressman Dingell     Oh  okay       do this  do that  do that  rotunda everything   I gave him everything  That s okay  I don t want anything for it  I don t need anything for anything  She calls me up   It s the nicest thing that s ever happened  Thank you so much  John would be so thrilled  He s looking down  He d be so thrilled  Thank you so much  sir   I said   That s okay  don t worry about it   Maybe he s looking up  I don t know  I don t know  Maybe  maybe  But let s assume he s looking down  But I gave him A   not A  not B   not B  I gave him the A   and she called me  She said   Oh  no   I won t go into the conversation  because it s not fair do that  But all I want to say is  let s put it this way  it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to     it was a     Okay  so that was what  February or something  Now they talk about this phony impeachment  and she s out there   Well  we have to look seriously at our president  because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States   Boo   And I can t be happy with that  because I love our country  I love this  and I love that   She loves everything  I said   She s a no  okay  No  but I look at her  and she s so sincere  and what happens  I vote to impeach Trump   And you know what  I didn t say   Who the hell knew this was even going to come up   I went through the whole Muller hoax  They did this big report  I was totally exonerated  They didn t even bring it up at the impeachment  because I was totally exonerated  If they saw one little kernel  one little quarter of a sentence   look what they did with one word  Remember this  what did I do  Why did I do  It s us  But they don t say it that way  They say   I   They read it totally different  schiff and his band of thieves  they read it  Now I say basically  very simple  do us a favor  our country  Do us  Do us  Not me  Our country  And then what do I say  I say   The United States Attorney General  Attorney General of the United States could speak to you  it would be great  okay  Because it s known for major corruption  In fact  the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction   on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty  and everything that was going on in Ukraine  right  He looked for it  that s how he got into office  He got into office that way  So we take it and they repeat it a thousand times  and they never say with the right   so I go wild  and we start  And the Republicans have got it right  Now we always correct him  but I use the word us  Us is the United States  our country  And then it actually says  I think  Comma  country  but they don t say that  They say  Do me a favor   How many times have you heard it  Where they say in a speech   And then the president said  do me a favor   Well  that s not what I said  I said   Do us a favor  our country   And then I said  the Attorney General of the United States  I didn t say my campaign  I said the Attorney General of the United States  I didn t say my campaign manager  Okay  I said the attorney   And these people want to impeach the President of the United States for that  Oh  and then what happened  Right  Then what happened  So then  the President of Ukraine  who s a quality person  said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  That was a killer for the Democrats  right  Then his foreign minister said the same thing  He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  There was no pressure  That s a killer  So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago  They tried to say that he s not a strong person  that he was weak  They used the word weak  that he was weak  and under the power of Trump  he said  Do you know how insulting that is  Anybody that becomes president of a country  and that s a big country and it s a tough country  you got to be tough  He s tough  But so what they re saying now is he was weak because the wording  it just doesn t fit  Okay  These are really dishonest people  And if the press was fair  this thing never would have happened  So the House Democrats are surrendering their majority  their dignity  their reputations  They look like a bunch of fools  And I ll tell you  we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party  I could read off a list of    names  But they re giving up their honor  and they ll receive a big backlash at the box office  When you take a look  that ballot box  that ballot box on November  rd  I think we re going to have crowds like we ve never had  And I ll tell you something  it used to be  they d always say   Oh  the Republicans   You know  in       I didn t run  I didn t run  right  They all said   Oh  we didn t   Well actually  we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about  We just approved     federal court justices      federal justices  including courts of appeal       We ll be up  probably by the end of the year  to      and for that  I thank President Obama  He gave me     openings  He gave me      I said to him  my people  I got there  because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court  We have two great Supreme Court judges  Right  Two Justices of the Supreme court  Kavanaugh  Gorsuch  Two great men  They re great  And how about the pain that they put Justice Kavanaugh through  right  Over a phony deal  I hate to tell you  Over a phony deal  What a disgrace  what they put that man through and that family through  Just remember it come November  You got to remember  it s a long time  You know  in the life of Trump     months is an eternity  It s a long time  Somebody said   Congratulations sir  you re going to win   I said   Don t say that  Just don t talk about it  Let s always pretend you re one point down   Like last time  Going to be close  Nope  it s going to be close  But what they put that man through was horrible  what they put his family through was horrible  And you know  those stories largely have been recanted  And frankly  the ones that didn t recant  I don t know what a Supreme Court judge does  but he should sue them  He should sue them  So we want to take back the House  we ll hold the Senate  and we ll keep the White House  You will have the greatest healthcare  You will continue with the greatest judges  You know  we have judges that are   We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal  I have to be always very truthful  because if I m a little bit off  they call me a liar  They ll say   He gets a Pinocchio  the stupid Washington Post  they have Pinocchio  I mean  even if you re saying things perfectly  it s a Pinocchio  There s nothing you can say where you don t get a Pinocchio  But what happens  what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story  They said  Whether you like him or not  the job he s done on judges and Supreme Court Justices  but the job he s done on judges is amazing  Say it s the most important thing  See  I don t agree  I say defense is the most  the military is the most  But once you re beyond the military  I mean to me defense is the most important  Because without good defense  maybe we don t need judges so much  right  It s like somebody said   Well  we violated the budget   I said   Do me a favor  don t worry about the budget  If we re attacked and aren t doing very well and somebody says   Well  at least we have a good budget   that doesn t work too well   Right  That doesn t work  So we have great military  we have great judges  we have great everything  Drug prices down  For the first time in    years  drug prices came down  And that was with no help from the Democrats  If they helped  because you need their votes  if they helped  I could get those drug prices down    and      Okay  And we just approved  and we re approving very soon for the Governor of Florida  Ron DeSantis  where he can buy  he has the right to go  we re giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country  where the prices for the identical drug  identical drug are     less  He s going to do that for the people of Florida  And we re going to do that for your governors if they want to do that  We ll get that down so far  Everyone in America can see straight through the Washington Democrats  phony  dangerous charade  Schiff makes up so many things  Pelosi makes it up  and she backs him up  I saw her on a television show  and George Stephanopoulos  that s another beauty  he said  even he said  he was defending me  I couldn t believe it  He made this statement   But you know he lied on that  He made up this stuff    No  he didn t  he didn t   So that means Nancy Pelosi said no  the statement that he made up  But it s all going to end soon  and it s going to come out to a beautiful  great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation  Thank you very much  So that s it  We have the greatest country  We ve turned around a ship  We need four more years  If we don t have it   Now  if you want to drive them crazy  we had one group in Pennsylvania  some guy started screaming       more years       They went crazy  And you know what they don t understand  When I do get out  they re all going to go out of business  They re making more money than they ve ever made  That crazy New York Times  one of the worst newspapers in the world  one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world  totally phony  They came out with a story  where it was a great headline for me  and the people that read it  the super radical left  they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story  Can you believe it  No  they re among the most dishonest people  But I ll never forget  before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady   Our First Lady is doing a great job  great job  I said   First Lady  you re so lucky I took you on this journey  this wonderful  beautiful journey   And it is  You know why it s a wonderful  beautiful journey  Because look at  what we re accomplishing is unbelievable  It s unprecedented  It is unprecedented what we re accomplishing   You re so lucky  I said it to all my people  I have great people in the back  I say  You folks are so lucky I took you on this  You could be home right now  relaxing   But I d rather be here  frankly  than any place  These rallies are great  They re inspiring  You are inspiring  And you know  it s funny  we re not even into election season  Yeah  it s a long way away  We re not even in it  And yet  I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the      election  Does that make any sense  I think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt  A lot of it has to do with the phony  witch hunt because you re smart people  You re the elite  They re not the elite  You re the elite  You re the elite  You do better than they do  They talk about it  don t you hate it   Well  the elite     Oh really  I went to better schools  Many of you went to better schools  We won t talk about homes  even though your homes are nicer  We won t talk about jobs  You see the jobs reports  You see what s happening  Do you see where wages are going up  You know  when I first started  when I was here  one of my first speeches  I was talking that people made more money  that was four years ago  so it was    years before that  so that s        years ago  They made more money    years ago than they were making when I got elected president  And they worked one job versus two or three jobs  Now it s going up beautifully and we want that  the salaries  And you know  the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker  It s percentage  the best  The blue collar worker  They had two and three jobs  The blue collar worker is going up the most  Anyway  so you know what else  The thing I m happiest about  African American unemployment  the lowest in the history of our country  African American  Remember I used to say  you remember  look at  you  Are you the greatest guy  Everyone thinks  do I pay  I m telling you  I have a group of African American guys  and gals by the way  that follow me around and they think I pay them  and I don t  I love them  they love me  They come  How many rallies have you come to  A lot  They re great people  just great  Thank you  I don t even know who the hell he is  Is that right  I don t know him  but I like him  I see him at so many rallies  I appreciate it  You and your group  they re great people  Thank you  So you re obviously doing well if you can travel around like that  right  Ah  he knows  I appreciate it  I really do  I think it s fantastic  Thank you  Thank you  But think of this  African American unemployment is the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country  Their poverty levels  they had a horrible poverty level  in the negative sense  now their poverty levels are the best they ve ever been in the history of our country  Same with Hispanic Americans  the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers  And the same with Asians  the best unemployment  And women  I m sorry     years  best in    years  I ve let the women down  But I think within another couple of months  you ll be historical  So only    years best  The best in    years  But what we re doing has been an incredible thing  It s an incredible thing  When I m on the debate stage with one of these characters  and they try and say negative stuff  I ll just say   Well  here s the story  In the history of our country  this group is doing the best  and that group is doing the best  and the women are doing the best  and everybody s doing  And frankly  you know what it is  The whole country s doing the best  Okay  The whole country is doing the best   So we have records and everything  and yet they re trying to  and they really are  I ve never seen anything like it  they re accusing me  really  of doing what Joe Biden   Biden admitted what he did  How about this  They protect him  Did you see the crummy debate  Those debates are so boring  They re dying in the ratings  They re dying  they re dying    While it s totally unsupported   What s unsupported  He s on tape saying that he s holding back    billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor  How about that question  I won t say who answered  because you know I m not  I actually used to like the guy  he was a nice guy to me  but now I don t like him so much  but that s okay  But he goes   While it s totally unsubstantiated  and while we beg your mercy that we re asking you even to bring up this question  but President Trump said you refused to give    billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son s company   And Sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer  and that s the end of it  That s it  Then whenever I bring it up  do you ever notice they always use    While these charges are totally unsubstantiated   He s on tape  If that were me  it s the electric chair  They would bring the electric chair back  No  the guy s on tape  and they always say it s unsubstantiated   It is not supported by fact  one of them the other day  they finally changed the word  It is supported by fact   No  it s supported by tape  No  it s unbelievable  In many ways  I d like to have him win because number one  he s going to have to eventually answer that question  and number   She said he doesn t know where he is  That s the other problem  Now  I ve been doing this for a long time  and I have much bigger crowds than anybody s ever had in history  By the way  do you know what  I say it against the fake news  because you know what they re going to say  Every stadium is packed  I give my people one instruction  get the largest stadium you can get  Now  that s why I was a little surprised  But in Battle Creek  you don t have that many  right  Not too many stadiums  But I wanted to be here  You know why I wanted to be here  First of all the crowd is incredible  The crowd outside  But let me tell you  No  you know why I wanted to be here  Because we have a lot of choices  but I wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly  and I said   I want to be there   Pretty simple  pretty simple  Pretty simple  I wanted to be here for that reason  and I just want to say thank you  because I ll tell you what  you came in   I don t know  I didn t get       but we got a damn good percentage  right  We got a damn good percentage  So it s really thrilling to be here  But we re joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders  Your Michigan House Speaker  Lee Chatfield  Where s Lee  Lee  come up if you want  Come on  what the hell  we have nothing else to do  Should we get him up  Yes  Come up Lee  come up Lee  get up here  Come on up  Lee  Republican Party Chairwoman  Ronna McDaniel  who I spoke to  And the bottom line on the end of her story  so when I won I said   Who s going to head up the RNC   I said   I got to get that woman from Michigan   Remember they were all saying   You can t win Michigan   Now we re going to win it by so much  you better remember all those  Every time a car plant opens  please think about Trump  Come on up here  Lee  Michigan GOP Chairwoman  Laura Cox  Thank you  Hate to tell you  but all your congressmen  you know where they are right now  Your congressmen  all of your Congresspeople  men  wonderful people  they re at a place called Congress right now  They re doing an unbelievable job of supporting your President and supporting you  They had a choice   Sir  should we leave and be there   I said   Don t leave  Stay right where you are   That s why we got that vote  That s some vote  right Lee  The Chairman of the Woman s Workers and Workers for Trump  and a proud union autoworker  Terry Bowman  who s been so terrific  Thank you  Terry  Come on up  And while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment  we re focused on jobs  jobs  jobs  This group  local leaders  And all your Washington folks  they are right where they have to be in Washington tonight  Thank you  Thank you  Great job  Thank you very much  We ve eliminated more job killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country  whether it s four years or eight years  or in one case  much more than eight years  In a period of two and a half years  we have eliminated more regulations than any other president  by far  You re saving almost        a year because of regulation cuts  Total income gains for median households will reach         a family  I ll give you a couple of quick numbers  So under President Bush  for eight years  you saved       meaning you took in     bucks  Okay  fine  Under President Obama  you took in       Under President Trump  including the energy savings  and the regulation savings  and the tax cut savings  it s more than         in less than three years  Pretty good  right  So for two eight years  you had a     450  and a      That s eight years       In less than three years  you had more than          That goes right into your pockets  It s one of the reasons our economy is doing well  because  as they say  the consumer is doing better than they ve ever done  And that s great  that s what we wanted  We ve ended the war on American energy  and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth  And these maniacs want to close it up  How about going to Texas  You know Beto  What  Remember what he said  I said   Oh  this guy s a loser  You know a salesman  like if you re a great salesman  you never talk that you re a great salesman  You don t walk in and say   Well  I m a great salesman  I can sell     Any guy that does that  they re no good  It s those quiet type that get you  You know  the ones that don t talk  So Beto  when he first got in  remember this clown  He gets in  no  no  he gets in   I was made for this job  to run for president   After about two weeks  they killed him  He was gone  But you remember  he was against the Bible  he was against religion  he was against guns  and he was against oil and gas  And he comes from Texas  I said  that s a platform  Think of it  He s against religion  he s against guns  and against oil and gas  Think of it  I don t like to bring it up because he s gone zone  but he comes from Texas  I said   Abraham Lincoln can t win in Texas with that platform   But they are  all of them  they want to close up your energy  It s a big deal  They want to close up your steel mills  They don t want your steel mills  Look at what I ve done for steel  I mean  the steel is back  We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places  and your steel mills that are doing great  they re expanding all over the country  And they were going to be out of business within two years  The way they were going  they were gone  United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions  Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U S  auto industry forever  And you know why  Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric  I want to have an alternative  a big alternative  You re going to always have the alternative  And a lot of people don t know of the electric can ever catch the gas  you know  And by the way  there ll be different forms of energy coming along  But they want to close them up  and we re not closing them up  We re going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing  you can have it for a lot of different reasons  We re even bringing back the old light bulb  You heard about that  right  The old light bulb  which is better  I say   Why do I always look so orange   You know why  Because of the new light  they re terrible  You look terrible  They cost you many  many times more  like four or five times more  And you know they re considered hazardous waste  When a light bulb is out  you ve got to bring it to a dump  So let s say  over here in Battle Creek  where s your nearest dump  Okay  that s what  a couple of hundred miles away  So every time you lose   drive a couple of hundred miles  right  I said   How many people do that   Nobody  What do they do  They throw it in the garbage  But you know what it is  because it s all gas  It s much more expensive  four or five times more  And I came into office  I did a lot of this  Sinks  showers  all of this stuff  I did a lot of it  No water comes out  You have areas where there s so much water  you don t know what to do with it  You turn on the shower  you re not allowed to have any water anymore  I mean  we do a lot of it  Dishwashers  we did the dishwasher  right  You press it  Remember the dishwasher  you d press it  boom  there d be like an explosion  five minutes later you open it up  the steam pours out  the dishes  Now you press it    times  the women tell me   Again   You know  they give you four drops of water  and they re in places where there s so much water  they don t know what to do with it  So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers  We re going back to the old  By the way  by the time they press it    times  you spend more on water  and electric  Don t forget  the whole thing is worse because you re spending all that money on electric  So we re bringing back standards that are great  and better machinery that you can have the water again  right  But with the light bulb  I said   What s going on with the light bulbs  A lot of people are complaining about the cost   So I had a couple of experts come in  I said   Tell me  what gives a better light    Well  we liked the old light bulb better   I said   I like it better   And so what I did is you can have either one  If you want to buy the newer kind  you can  And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind  like I do  So we re bringing back the old light bulb  So it s a much less expensive  it probably gives a better light  But whatever it is  and you ll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb  I mean  it sounds like little  but it s big stuff  Okay  It s big stuff  and we re doing it with a lot of other things  our dishwashers  And you know  I won t tell you one of the things  because every time I tell you  they do a big number on it  You know the one I m talking about  right  Sinks  right  Showers  And what goes with a sink and a shower     times  right     times  Not me  of course  not me  but you  him  But I never mention that  because one time I mentioned all three  I said   Sinks  showers  and toilets   The headline was   Trump with the toilets  toilets   That s all they want  They don t even mention it  So I didn t mention that  okay  I go off the record  But you know what  It s terrible  You want to wash your hands  you turn on the sink  no water comes out  So you leave the water going    times as long  it s the same thing  You have a shower  drip  It s no good for me  For me  You know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business  They always used to say I wore a hairpiece  It s okay  I know people wear hairpieces  But they always used to say  They don t say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms  If you wear one of those suckers  you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you  You look handsome  don t worry about it  But in the last two decades before my election  we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country  The people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they ve wanted to do for so many years  And that s why it doesn t work  We look so forward to taking it on  and it is all about cleaning the swamp  draining the swamp  and we have a very  very big  bad  dangerous swamp  Okay  that s enough of that  That s enough  So among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the U S  auto industry  I withdrew from the horrible Trans Pacific Partnership  That would have ended your auto industry  A lot of people don t know that  but I do  Remember TPP  We were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off  The people that made these trade deals  it s like  where do they come  Like the one in Korea  that was a Hillary Clinton special  She said   This will produce         new jobs   And I said   Well  what happened   He said   Well  she was right   Except it was for South Korea  not for us  No  it s true  It produced         jobs for South Korea  These deals were so bad  But now they re getting really good  and some of them are getting great  and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal  Wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time  But we have to go through a little pain  because we have to do it  and then they all say   We re going to withdraw  and then I say  You can withdraw  I don t care  We re putting tariffs on your country   Then they say   We d love to make a deal  sir   The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong  Since the election  we ve created        brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs  manufacturing jobs  Remember the statement by President Obama   You d have to wave a magic wand   Remember the magic wand  Because manufacturing   And I said   You know  that sounds strange  What do you do if you don t have manufacturing  How do you make things   Right  Manufacturing jobs won t happen  Well  we ve got         manufacturing jobs  and you re going to see a big  big increase  The truth is  we need more people  You know what  We need more people  We need more people coming into the country  and they re going to come in  and they re going to come in through merit  and they re going to love our country  and they re going to respect our country  and they re going to work  We do need more people  They re opening these massive  Foxconn in Wisconsin  they re opening these massive plants and it s hard to get people  We want people coming in  but they have to come in  only they have to come in through merit  Fiat Chrysler recently announced a      billion investment in Michigan  including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation  And General Motors recently announced a      million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant right here in Michigan  Come on  General Motors  let s go  General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building  I wasn t happy about that  That was the only building I had a problem within the whole car industry  right  Right  You know the one I m talking about  I didn t like that  Anyway  but they re spending money  you know  what can I tell you  But these companies are coming in  a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to  I say   You have to  or we re not trading with you anymore   Because we had such big deficits with these countries  With Japan  we had a     billion deficit  I said  Shinzo  he s great Prime Minister of Japan  But he said   But nobody has ever asked us to do this   I said   I m asking you   They are building many  many plants  They re building many plants now in the United States  the Japanese  And after years of rebuilding foreign nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  Is that okay  We were surrounded with globalists  You know  they think it s okay  You open a plant in some country that you never heard of  they make your product  they send it  In the meantime  they close all their factories here  We re not doing that anymore  Those are globalists  They think it s wonderful to have deficits  I don t  They think it s great  It s a great thing to have deficits  No  those are globalists  The globalists are passe   our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you  the American people  before anybody else  We must care for our own  We must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans  I don t even know what s happening  It s terrible  And we ve moved out thousands and thousands of MS   thugs out of our country  And we have agreements now with Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador  They didn t use to take them back  If we had a murderer  then we should get them the hell out  We don t really want them in our prisons and take care of them for        years  We want to bring them back  They wouldn t take them  The planes used to go around and around  don t land  don t land  With us  they land  We worked out deals with every one of them  We stopped giving them all the aid  We re giving them all this money and then they said   We re not going to let you land  We re not going to let you take them back   I said   That s okay      million  we were giving them  I said  now we give them    we give them nothing  All of a sudden they said   We would love to have them back   We would love it  It s wonderful to have them back  In June  two illegal aliens in Sandusky  Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife  Then  they hid her body in a water drain  A criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death  a single mother of five young children  It s happening all the time  Far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities  which deliberately release dangerous  violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets  We had a great election in North Carolina recently  two great congressmen got elected  you don t hear about it  when they win  you don t ever hear about it  just a few months ago  Two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I went in and said   Talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities  and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities  Soon as I mentioned that  boom  they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great  Great thing  The sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you  the people of California  they don t like sanctuary cities either  They re stuck with them because they have crazy politicians  Earlier this year  authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County  Michigan  anybody know Kent County  Released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle  They let him go to roam free in Michigan communities  If you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan  if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens  if you want to have a safe life  frankly  it s so crazy what they re doing  You wouldn t even believe it  You have only one choice in       you must vote Republican  Thank you  I m surprised  As you know  you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan  I was almost surprised to hear it  but you have them  It s one of those progressive things  They think they re doing a wonderful favor for the world  And now we re getting these prosecutors that  you murder somebody  they give you two months  they fight that you don t even have to go to jail  What s going on is crazy  Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  illegal crossings are down     since may and we ve ended catch and release  We ve ended it  We could ve ended it so easily  It s called the loophole  You catch him and then you release him into a country  That s what you had to do by law  And if you don t do that  they arrest the border patrol people  You believe this  The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people  These are the people because look  when you have a caravan of eight or        people  a lot of those people  do you think that Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador  do you think they re sending us their finest  I don t think so  Alright  How about the lottery  That was a Schumer deal  Chuck Schumer  crying Chuck  crying Chuck Schumer  I used to be a big contributor to him  he used to kiss my ass  Chuck Schumer  He d do anything  He would ve done anything for me  Anything I asked him  get Schumer on the phone   You do this  you do that  You get him on the phone  that son of a bitch   He would have done  I didn t need anything  but he would have done anything  Now it s like   The prisoner has not acted    Give me a break  Give me a break  Find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck  give all that money back please  Carolyn Maloney  give that money back  Every penny should come back  They act so pompous  They act so righteous  They re not righteous  They re not righteous  They re bad people  The far left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now  Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor      million people are going to lose  A lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that s phenomenal  And that s what you want  They want to take it away       They want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night  I don t think so  Not in this group  And you know what  Some people  it s good so people  but can you imagine  They want to take away     million people  great  private  highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor  Remember Obama     times   You can have your doctor  you can have your plan   Didn t work out that way  did it  I think we should impeach him for that  Let s impeach him  for that  for the IRS scandal  for the guns  Remember the guns  he was giving them to anybody that wanted them  He gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn t have them registered  right  Not to good  Impeach him  Why didn t the Republicans impeach him  Those were really  how about giving around      billion in cash  How about that  By the way  I ended the Iran nuclear deal  I hope you happy  much different country  But how about giving Iran      billion in cash  Many big planes going over to Iran  loaded up to the ceiling with cash  You know what      billion  you ever see like at a casino     million wrapped up  It s a big pile of stuff  that s a million  Now multiply it       billion in cash he gave  So  why is he allow to do that  Did anybody try to impeach him for that  Everybody knew it was wrong  Republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians  Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother s womb  right up until the moment of birth  Right  That is why I ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God  Democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  And that s what it is  The Republican party is the party of the American worker  the American family  and the American dream  And that s really what it is  We re also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln  A lot of people forget that  but we have to bring it up  To protect the health and safety of our citizens  we awarded      million to improve water infrastructure in Flint  How badly was Flint  Who were the geniuses that did that to you  You have clean water coming into Flint  They had to pay a very tiny little fee  So instead  they go into this horrible  horrible  really polluted water and the water comes out of there  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks  and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people  It hurt the people  But we re getting it fixed  And I know your previous governor was a Republican  but I was not a big fan of his  I was not  but I m not a big fan of the one that can t fix the potholes either  We re committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth  and that s what it s about  It s about clean air and it s about clean  beautiful water  And it s about keeping our industry  not closing it because of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord  How s Paris doing  I don t think too well  How s Paris doing with the yellow vests  The yellow vests  You know why  Because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in France never heard of  It s not working out too well  We re lowering prices  We re lowering taxes  We re making it possible  I mean  look at gas prices now  Look at gas prices  I recognize Israel s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem  And we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Big deal  For years  you watched as your politicians apologized  Member   I would like to apologize  I would like to apologize   Nah  we don t apologize  Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan  You re getting your auto industry back  At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation  If you want your children to grow up  a land of safety  it s really  we want a land of safety  justice  Well  I don t know  When I look at those FBI reports we got out  we got to clean up a lot  What they ve done to hurt people  what they ve done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people  what they ve done to hurt people  I think one of the best things I did as president  a lot of people would say   With all what we ve done for the economy and  but one of the best things is firing James Comey s ass out of there  Boy  those reports are kept  Did you see the other day  Well  ah  ah   First time now he said  in other words  he s     there folks  He s hit the golden pond  Anyway  so what we re doing is  we re doing things that are going to make our victory  it s like a tree  We need that extra four years  We ve done so much  even Right to Try  You know Right to Try  People were traveling  they re terminally ill  they re traveling all over the world  We have the best medical in the world  the best doctors  the best labs  best hospital  They re traveling all over the world  to try and get  because it takes years to get something approved  And I said   Wait a minute folks  why aren t we doing this   And they ve been trying to do it for    years  They couldn t get it done  Not that easy  The drug companies didn t want the liability  the country didn t want the liability  the insurance companies didn t want the liability  I said   Here s what we do  We ll sign an agreement with the people where you re exculpated from all liability    Huh  That s a good idea   And it s a very strong agreement so we can t get sued  But I said   Listen  they were worried they re going to hurt people   I said   These people are terminally ill  They re terminally ill  and so we do it now   Nine months ago  all the legislators at the    years  so if somebody s sick  they don t have to go to Asia  they re have to go to Europe  Or if you re poor  you go home and you die  Now what happens  Very simple  You sign that document  they work it out  You wouldn t believe how many lives are being saved  It s incredible  It s incredible  I m very proud of it  Right to Try  I hope you don t need it  You don t want it  You don t want it  Okay  But if you do  it s there  With your help  we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  We will enact the greatest trade deals ever made  They ll result in more products  proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  made in the USA  We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  What we re doing is unbelievable  We re so far ahead of everybody  What we ve done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of what we re doing  it would take    13     years to get things approved  It s down to a much smaller number  but we re finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America  We ve started the process  Who would ve thought that  In    years  it s a    year process  we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been been started before I came to office  It was just wasted time  We will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  Above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America  We support  protect and defend the constitution of the United States  We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  They re incredible  and that includes ICE  You know how tough these people are  These are great patriots  They love our country  Even the sheriffs alone for  some of the people that they re dealing with  These guys walk into the golem s nest and in some cases they just swing it out  They can have it  They love it  These are great  If we didn t have them  and I told you before  they re taking out bad  bad  bad people by the thousands  especially MS   gang members  Who s going to do that  Who s going to do that  Anybody in the front row  I don t know  What about you  You re a tough guy  You might do it  You could do it  I don t know  You might  yeah  you can  What you like  We re going to recruit you  I think you could handle yourself  Now  these are tough people  right  You got to be tough  Then they get accused  they re too tough  Oh  they re too tough  You have some of these guys  They knife people  They don t even need a gun because it s more painful  They knife the two young girls     years old  Beautiful  They cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them  These are animals  And then Nancy Pelosi said  I shouldn t use the term animal  And by the way  she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the Pacific ocean and into their beaches  She ought to go and take care of her district in San  Do you see what s going on  And it rains and it s filth and it s needles and it s drugs and it s  you know what  It s everything and it goes right into those storm sewers  Storm  not sanitary  storm and it goes right out into the Pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine Los Angeles and San Francisco  but we ve just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they re doing  And Nancy Pelosi is playing games  She ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything  San Francisco was the most beautiful city  When you look at what s happened with the tents all over the place  where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat  they re getting sick  Diseases are coming back that this world hasn t seen for    40     years  It s a disgrace  She ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense  We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  We believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy are the true American way  We believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great American flag  And we live by the words of our national motto and it s always going to be up there  They want to take everything down  They don t want Thomas Jefferson anymore  They don t want anything  That s a terrible thing and we fight for it  now  We fight  These words will never be taken off  I don t care where I am  If I m up there  if I m down here  I don t know  but we ll be fighting  We ll never take these words off  in God we trust  We stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood  sweat and tears for this beloved nation  This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line  It s the place where General Motors  Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation  It gave us Motown  the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest  This is the American mid west  And Michigan is the state where generations of strong  tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world  And we are making it bigger  better and stronger than ever before  by far  Loyal citizens like you help build this country  And together  we are taking back our country  We are returning power to you  The American people  the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted  but with us  you will never be forgotten again  The forgotten men and women of this country will never  ever be forgotten again  And I m fighting for you  And I love doing it with everything that I have  And I will never  ever stop  And you know that  I will say I could have a much easier life  Some people say   Why is he doing it   You know why I m doing it because we re doing the thing and look what we re doing is we re bringing back our country again  We re respected again  we re respected again  We are so respected  you don t even know how respected  I went to NATO where we were being ripped off because the other countries  you have    countries  and the other countries weren t paying their bills  They were delinquent in real estate  I noticed people are using that word  I ve been using it for the last year  It s like a real estate trend  That s when they don t pay their rent  right  Well  they weren t paying and you have to see this chart  until I got there  They got to pay and they said   Well  does that mean you won t protect us   I said   You don t want the answer to that question   Over the last  and the Secretary General Stoltenberg  over the last period of just two years  I raised  not from us  nothing from us       billion  but that s nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying      billion more  All of those countries  My biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO  He says   I never thought this could   I m telling you  if you look  it s like    years just down  President Obama would go there  make a speech   I d like to thank everybody for being here  Thanks  Look  great job  Sayonara  Goodbye   Bush  they all did  Nobody ever asked for money  We were spending for      of NATO  We re protecting Europe  They rip us off on trade  right  They rip us off like crazy  We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade  We re changing that  but it s a long time  It s been going on a long time  They don t take your product  They don t take your cars  They don t take your farm product  They don t take your medical machines  We do a big business  They sell us  We don t sell them because they put restrictions  We have better equipment than them  but they make it so that our equipment doesn t qualify  It s called artificial barriers or non monetary barriers  It s brutal what they do  I m telling you  they re as bad as China  just smaller  They are as bad as China  just smaller and now China s doing great  We re very happy  but we have to do something with that  We have to take care of our people  We can t be ripped off by these countries  so NATO is ripping us off militarily  but now they re starting to pay big money and that s good  We want to help them  We want to be there with them  but they have to pay  They have to pay       billion and the fake news doesn t even want to talk about it  They don t want to talk about it  They talk about other things  They don t want to talk about that  When you d get a chance though  just a couple of weeks  maybe you could say over a short period of time  NATO countries will be paying      billion more  More  not total  More  How s that  Good  That s not too bad  Nobody else could do that  I guarantee  I won t tell you what took place in those closed door meetings  Some of them don t like me  They like Obama  Germany likes Obama  A lot of these countries  France  they like Obama  It s embarrassing  In France  President Obama is more popular than President Trump  Well  I should be  I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they re ripping us off on the internet  Okay  If I ever become more popular  that means I m not doing my job  You should say he s out  It s true  I could be loved in Germany  I could be loved in Germany  Oh  they d love me  My father came from Germany  parents and I could be loved in Germany  They d like me so much  but then I m not doing my job for you  Have to do it  Have to do it  With your help  your devotion  your drive  we re going to keep on working  We re going to keep on fighting  We are going to keep on winning  winning  winning because we are one movement  one people  one family and one glorious nation  under God  America is thriving like never before  And ladies and gentlemen of Michigan  the best is yet to come  Great state  Great state  You better remember all those jobs in a year from now  I tell you  I ll say   That state let me down   I don t think that s going to happen  I m hearing very good thing  You know the interesting thing  before it was like a promise  I said I m going to bring car back  I m going to bring this  I m going to be pres  it was all like  it s good  You believed me  I was successful  all this  but now we ve done it  We have done more than I promised  no politics  I promised  we ve done more than we promised  No politician I think  has ever done that  Together we will make America wealthy again  We will make America strong again  We will make America proud again  We will make America safe again and we will make America great again  Thank you  Thank you  Michigan  Thank you '",

      "\u001b[1;31mKeyError\u001b[0m: 'Thank you  Thank you  Thank you to Vice President Pence  He s a good guy  We ve done a great job together  And Merry Christmas  Michigan  Thank you  Michigan  What a victory we had in Michigan  What a victory was that  One of the greats  Was that the greatest evening  But I m thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas  the greatness of America and the glory of God  Thank you very much  And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again  Did you notice  Saying Merry Christmas  I remember when I first started this beautiful trip  this beautiful journey  I just said to the First Lady   You are so lucky  I took you on this fantastic journey  It s so much fun  They want to impeach you  They want to do worse than that   By the way  by the way  by the way  it doesn t really feel like we re being impeached  The country is doing better than ever before  We did nothing wrong  We did nothing wrong  And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we ve never had before  Nobody s ever had this kind of support  But this sacred season  our country is thriving and it s thriving truly like it has never  it has never happened before to the extent what s happening now  And by the way  your state  because of us  not because of local government  but because of us  because of the job that we ve done  Because I understand she s not fixing those potholes  That s what the word is  It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you  We don t want to do that  But she s not fixing the potholes  But Michigan s had the best year it s ever had  Best year it s ever had  And that s because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they re coming in from Japan and they re coming in from a lot of other places  Look what s happening  And you know  I don t know if you know this  but probably    years ago I was honored  I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody  whoever  I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan  Can you believe it  Long time  And that was long before I ever decided to do this  I was happy  I had a beautiful life  What the hell did I do this for  But look how we re doing  Do we love it  I love it  But anyway  I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to    years ago and I came to Michigan  He said   You re still the Man Of The Year   Thank you  Who said that  Thank you  So I came in and I remember the speech so well  I said   Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies  Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China  they build them in China  they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs  you lose your factories  the companies leave and you get nothing  Why are they lying   I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it  We ve stopped it  And you see that  And we just made the USMCA  We re getting rid of NAFTA  which I think is the worst trade deal ever  And it s very exciting  It s a great deal  It s a great deal  It s going to stop exactly what we were just talking about  It makes it very  very prohibitive  They can do it  but they ve got to pay a hell of a big price to do it  And history has proven that stops them  But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico  with Canada  Now  from the standpoint of the farmers  you know what s going on  We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada  We had attacks on dairy products       tariff  nobody talked about it  with Canada  And we had some really bad things with Mexico  We now have a wonderful deal  And if we didn t have a good deal  you know what I would have done what  What  I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it  right  That would have been it  Unfortunately the deal s been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened  And she had a lot of pressure  especially from manufacturing areas  farm areas  a lot of pressure to sign it  So here s what happens  So I get along with labor  I had a lot of union labor vote for me  tremendous amount of labor  In New York where I come from  we have a lot of unions  And that s okay  That s fine  So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed  we ll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal  And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that s okay  Whatever it takes  For seven months  it sits  They don t do anything  We give  And by the way  I spoke to the unions the day before I say   Fellows  you got to get it done   And union labor loves me and I love you too sir  I love you too sir  So we have a great deal with Mexico  with Canada  And it is true  I say it out loud because I say it to them right now  If they ever wanted to break the deal  that s okay  If somebody wants to break a deal with me  you always have to have an alternative  right  And this country  the deals we made  we did a deal with South Korea  That s great  We did a deal with Japan     billion dollar deal with Japan  It was just a little piece of a deal  Okay  That was a piece of a deal  And I said to Japan   Look  you got to make this deal or we re going to put a     tariff on the cars  And that s more money than anything we re talking about   That s all right  That s all right  That s all right  Get her out  Ger her out of here  Oh well  You re about to hear the greatest speech you ve ever heard  And that s going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot  Massive riots  Fake news  But seriously  look  look  look  they won t say it  They won t say it  because when we have protesters all in favor  they don t talk about it  but there s a slob  There s a real slob  Wait  wait a minute  She ll get hell when she gets back home with mom  But she made  Look  she screams a little bit  And you know what I like to do  Avoid them  Because I ll tell you the big problem  I could hardly hear her  What happens is all of you people go crazy  Look  look  look  and the place  Okay  so there s one disgusting person who made  Wait  wait  who made a  I wouldn t say this  but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right  Now they won t say that  the fake news  they won t say it  If one of us did that  it would be like the biggest story ever  I think it s terrible  And I ll tell you the other thing  I don t know who the security company is  but the police came up  but they want to be so politically correct so they don t grab her wrist lightly and get her out  They say   Oh  would you please come  Would you please come with me   Sure   Ma am  would you   And then she gives the guy the finger and he   Oh  Oh   You got to get a little bit stronger than that  folks  And they    Making another group of tariffs  seven and a half percent  This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal  which they want to start  but we re taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted     billion and    billion the previous year  helps the farmers  So you know what we do  out of that big check that we get  all that money flows into the treasury  Out of the big check  we gave the farmers    billion dollars and    billion for the previous year  And you know  the incredible thing  and I was with a lot of farmers  I was with a group of    farmers at the White House  You know what they said to me  I said   Don t worry about it  We re going to take care of you guys   And I used a bad word  You know what word I used  We re going to get you a subsidy  And they said this two years ago  I said   How much were you targeted for   This was the first year      billion  sir   The second year was     They were target  That s what they didn t get from China  So I said   It s all right  we re going to give you a subsidy of the same and we re going to take it out of the tariffs and we re going to have billions and billions of dollars left over   And they said   Sir  we don t want money  We just want a level playing field   I ve never seen that before  I ve never seen that before  So we will have invested in our military  since I m here  which is less than three years  Our military  by the way  in all due respect to the previous two administrations  our military was depleted  It was depleted  It was in bad shape  We had fighter jets that were    years old  We had planes that were    years  You heard where the father flew them  the grandfather flew them  and now the young son comes in  We ve got the best equipment in the world now  Spent two and a half trillion dollars  made in the USA  Two and a half trillion  We will shortly  That ll be all finished  We re going to have the greatest  Now we have the best planes  We re going to have the best ships  We re building a lot of ships now  We re building the most powerful weapons in the world  Now  we don t want to even talk about it  We never want to use them  But you know  the way we re not going to have to use them is if we have them  We re building submarines  the power of which nobody s ever seen before  Nobody s ever seen before  It s funny  we have these companies come in  I like to make good deals  You like to make good deals  That s what we do  right  So these really countries that come in  prime ministers  presidents  sometimes dictators  those we can t deal with too much   Sir  we d like to buy a nuclear submarine   I say   No thanks   I turn them all down  You have no idea how many people  But we re building some of the  They re the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind  I say mankind and womankind  They can definitely fight  They re the real deal  These guys  so good looking  I said   You could be a movie star  Go to Hollywood    No sir  I like doing what I m doing   So I said to these guys  you going to see  just like central casting  I said  I said   Fellas  how good is this plane   They said   Sir  it s great    Why    Because the enemy can t see it   That helps  Stealth  It s actually called super stealth  So I said   You mean they can t see  so you shoot at them but they can t   He said   They have no idea where we are  sir   I said   That sounds good to me   Nobody does it  Nobody can do it  We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes  we bought in a lot of great stuff  And I won t tell you the story  but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace  and one of the generals came up to me and said   Sir  don t go  Don t do it    Why    We don t have the ammunition   And I said two things  I never want to hear a President  Right  We never want to have a President hear that again  nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then  But  another thing we did  which to me is such an incredible thing to have done  It s such an honor  So our last US Armed Forces  the last branch was the Air Force  right  That was many  many decades ago  We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces  The Space Force  So I ll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else   See that Space Force  That was my baby   And you think that was easy  That s not easy  Because you have Democrats that do not like our military  They do not like our military  And we did something yesterday  because for three years I would see people that run  Incredible people  the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country  And every year they d come in and they d be looking for help  They needed help and they do need help with it and it s great and they do an incredible job  So many great schools  but they need help  And every year they d have to come and come  I got to know them actually  I said   The only bad thing is you won t see me too much anymore   Because we just provided record funding for a nation s Historically Black Colleges and Universities  And it s longterm  they re not going to have to come  So I said   Look  we could do it where we do it every year or we ll do what we have  What do you want   They said   Let us just have it   So we ll miss them  But they are great people  They ve done an incredible job  And our extraordinary jobs boom  which created another         jobs last month  and then you add the undercount from the previous two months  you re close to         jobs  And they said  if you re a business watcher which I am  I love watching business  but they said they were guessing  could be    0  could be    0  maybe     maybe      somebody said  Then the number comes out 266     with an adjustment  Remember about four months ago when we had one little period  right  We had one little period where there was a little downturn  They said   Oh  Oh  we think we re going into a recession   I said   Don t worry about it    We think we re going into a recession   They were willing to lose their wealth  They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own  what do you guys own back there  Let it go  They ll go bust  They don t care  Anything to get rid of us  Not me  us  And you know what  Then all of a sudden  and now for the last couple of weeks  we ve set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets  So  as of yesterday  we ve had     record days in the stock market now  and that s in less than three years  So when I see that I don t care because I don t  I m not allowed to have stock  I can t have stock  They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand  I agree  I can  But you know what  I ll tell you what  What I see  I see tremendous job growth because we re setting records  But you know what I also see  The    ks where people are up      they re up      they re up      I tell you the story all the time  I mean  I have people coming up to me  and a man came up  a policeman  I ve told this story  but I ve had many  so many times  but this guy in particular  because it was early and that was a year ago  That was a long time ago  Right now it s much higher than that  But he said   Sir  I want to thank you  My wife thinks I m a loser  All my life  we never did well with the    ks  with stocks  Everything I invested  I m up      sir  She thinks I m a financial genius  She s so in love with me  She so in love   He said   She said   Darling  I think you re one of the greatest investors  Why don t you do this professionally   And I don t even know what I m doing  sir  I just have all these stocks   So I just wanted to tell you  I look at a    k  who has    ks here  So that s what I see  I don t care about the rich ones  I care about everybody  I care  I care about everybody actually  Ford motor company just announced that it is investing     billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area  creating another      Michigan jobs  And that s on top of the many other investments we ve gotten from Japanese companies  car companies  and other companies  But they re all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan  And I say   Hey  go to Michigan   Sometimes they ll go south and that s okay  whatever  I want them in this country  But ideally I want to fill them up  We re doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies  Now you re back  You re back  So  you re back  Very proud of you  Very proud of you  But while we re creating jobs  fighting for Michigan workers  and achieving numbers that you ve never seen before  incredible victories for the American people are happening  The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage  You see what s going on  I ll tell you  these people are crazy  You ever hear   It s the economy  stupid   You know that was Clinton s saying  If you have a good economy  I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it  Nobody talks about it  If you re a Democrat  they say    Oh  it s the economy   If the economy s any good  And let me just tell you a little secret  If crooked Hillary would ve won  your economy would have crashed  You were going down  The regulations were taking it down  The taxes were taking it down  instead of being up     or whatever you re up  a lot  you would have been down  you would have been at less than half  It was crashing  For all those people that would say   Oh  it s the Obama   Let me tell you something  You were dying  And if you look at that first period of a couple of months  it was a disaster  but it was heading south  And as sure as you re standing  and I m sorry we couldn t get you seats  we didn t have any room  And by the way 20     people outside had to leave  You know  It s so cold outside we told them   Don t worry about a screen  go home  go home and watch   But we had  this is about a       seat arena  And I said to my people   Why so small   Are we spoiled  I watch these guys come in like Biden  he has a big rally and they get    people show up  No  it s true  I don t understand it  And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out  I m killing everybody  And they hate me  USA Today hates me  But there s a poll  we re beating everybody  But  so Biden has this rally  they ve got     seats  but only a small number of people  So you know what they do  They set up a round table  So think of these people  They come in  they think they re going to listen to the speech  they end up sitting on a round table discussing  They must ve been happy  right  We don t have enough room for round tables  I m sorry folks  No  they set up a round table but I think we re doing great  And how do you beat what we ve done  With the economy  with our great vets  with choice  You ve finally got choice  They ve been trying to get it for almost    years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  And these people back here  Your seat or stand is better  Right  But you know what  They re going to be much more famous because the cameras can t see you  They can only see them  And the other thing  the cameras  do you ever notice  I go to these stadiums 25 30     people  They never show the crowd  You know why  Because they don t want to have  If crazy Pocahontas  if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever  She s in Manhattan  You got me  And people  I mean  I could have  I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and he d get a crowd that would be just as  He s     He d get a bigger crowd  But if she has the crowd   Oh  these crowds are so big   I ve had crowds over the last couple of weeks  We went to different Pennsylvania  Florida  But I mean thousands and thousands of people can t get into these NBA arenas  right  Big arenas  And we set records at everyone because we use the floor  Thank you  I appreciate it  But we use the floor  right  The basketball court  So we set records at every arena  They never even mention the crowds  They never mention the crowds  It s sort of amazing  You know what  I don t think we ve ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator  That s a long time ago  I don t think we ve ever had an empty seat  Now what the crooked media does though  if you got like over here  look how packed it is and there s thousands outside  but I   Please go home  You re going to catch pneumonia   But here s the thing  If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom  those cameras will turn to those two seats and they ll say  Trump wasn t able to fill up the arena   I always get nervous when I see some  I know they re coming back  Nobody ever leaves our speeches  Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally  But every time I see a man get up  I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they re getting up  The baby s going crazy and they re getting up  They re going to take it  But I know they re going to be right back  And I say   Fill those two seats  I don t want them to see it   Because they ll say   Couldn t fill up the arena   These are truly dishonest people  After three years of sinister witch hunts  hoaxes  scams  tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans  Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history  Was that the greatest  Remember when they all said  remember when they all said   No  no  You can t win Michigan  You can t   Then I went  I did one in Grand Rapids  right  Grand Rapids  We had        people that night  It was one o clock in the morning  That means it was Election Day when I started speaking  Hillary  Barack Obama  Michelle Obama  and Bill Clinton  they did an emergency trip  They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o clock  They got here at prime time  They started to speak  She had     people  I got here at one o clock in the morning the next day  which is now Election Day  How many people were there         people outside  inside  It was the last speech of Michigan  And they say   Well  sir  it s very hard to win Michigan   I said   Why would it be hard   Here s the beautiful thing  Everything I told you I ve done  but much more so  I said I was going to bring car companies back  I said I was going to bring in  I just hope you people know that  I just hope you know it  But I ll never forget that night  And in all fairness to Bill Clinton  he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office  I like him  I like him  But he told  you know the way they tried to shut him out  right  Because he s a pro  He s an instinct guy  right  He s instinct  He doesn t need  Right  Because he s a pro  He s an instinct guy  right  He s instinct  He doesn t need polling companies  Who the hell wants him  You know  if you want a polling company  pick up the newspaper  The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write  They write fake polls  It s true  they write fake polls  You call them suppression polls  You read them and you get depressed  because it looks like you re doing badly  They do that  I think it s almost worse than what they write  and you can t get much worse than what they write  So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary  his very dishonest wife  Crooked Hillary  Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary  He might  Maybe he just calls her crooked  He said   Crooked  I m telling you  Crooked  I don t like what I m seeing in Michigan  I don t like what I m seeing in Wisconsin   He said   I took the trip to Wisconsin and I ll tell you what  they had those Trump Pence signs all the way to the convention area  every lawn  every loan  I don t like Wisconsin   And then he said   Oh  don t worry about it   What the hell does he know  They told him   What do you know   Remember  they shut him out at the   They didn t want him talking  He was right  I mean  I don t want to cause any problems in the family  but he was right  But he talked about Wisconsin  Then he talked about Michigan  He said   Crooked  I m telling you  Crooked  I don t like what I m seeing in Michigan  I was in Michigan and I m telling you  they had those damn signs  I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn  and two of them on the car   And he said   You horrible human being  You d better start listening to me  because you re going to get your ass whooped  And you know what happened  You know what happened  She didn t listen  fortunately  And she didn t come to Michigan enough  And she didn t come to Wisconsin  I think at all  right  Because her polling data looked good  It looked good to me  too  Every time I went there with these crowds  So we won Wisconsin  We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel   where is Ronna  Where is Ronna  Ronna  she was so horrible  I didn t know her  Ronna McDaniel  and she was so aggressive  She kept calling and said   Could you please come out to Michigan   I said   Who the hell are you   And I said   What do you mean  another trip   So anyway  I made  we had these big crowds  I made it again  Then finally I said  two weeks out  I said   Ronna  no more  We re going to win it or we re not    Okay      in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids   Sir  could you come to Michigan tonight   And I thought  I was just about finished  I went to a last great state  and I said   It s over   Now I sit back and I watch  and let s see what happens  right  But she said   Could you come to Michigan   I said  that is the most aggressive human being I ve ever met  And we did it  And we won Michigan  And the word is that we re much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in      in Michigan  You better remember when you walk into   you know  it s November  rd this time  November  rd  By the way though  that evening  that incredible evening in November  one of the biggest nights in the history of television  You never hear them say it  so I might as well  That election   and my debates   you see their debates are dying  Who wants to watch Buttigieg  Buttigieg  Buttigieg  You know that you pronounce it they say   I heard some guy saying   No  no  because it s an unpronounceable name   That s why they call him Mayor Pete  right  Mayor Pete  Mayor Pete  Mayor Pete  I ve had you up to here  Mayor Pete  No  Buttigieg is leading  How does   no  you say it this way  You say it   they call him Mayor Pete  because nobody can pronounce his last name  That s the only   people think it says   by the way  you know what  I m not going to say bad things about him  You know why  I d love him to win  I thought I knocked off Pocahontas  I did it a year too early  a year too early  I give her credit  she then started to come back  I don t think she s going to make it though  She s gasping  She s gasping for air  But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg  and they said   Here s what you do  boot edge edge   Say   Edge  like the edge of a building  Edge edge  Buttigieg  Alfred E  Newman  You got to be older to know what that means  But congressional Democrats are directly attacking     million Michigan voters who rose up in       won the state  and now the Democrats are very upset  They want to get Michigan back  They just don t know how to do it  because they didn t do a thing for Michigan  They didn t do anything for Michigan  All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places  You know  I don t know if you know it  Mexico has     of your car business  You know that  right  Not because of me  They re not moving  But Mexico has       of our car business moved to Mexico  Can you believe this  Before I got there  but that s what I used to talk about  I said  when I was honored that night  I said  How do you let this happen  How do you let all these companies leave   It used to go    it s probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president  It might be the   and I had a lot of them  Immigration  I had a lot of them  but that may be the single biggest  With today s illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment  the do nothing Democrats  and they are do nothing   all they want to do is focus on this  what they could be doing   are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter  This lawless  partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party  Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks  It s crazy  It s crazy  You know why  Because people  we have an election right down the road  I announced three months ago that I m running  right  I ll give you a little clue  I announced because I figured once I announce  they d never impeach  nobody would be so stupid  But they d been trying to impeach me from day one  They ve been trying to impeach me from before I ran  okay  Because if you remember when I ran  I went immediately to number one  never came off number one  We had center stage from day one in the debates  So we had  I don t know 14     debates  We had a total of     actually  People forgot there was one that they never talk about it  but that s okay  But we had    people  and I was center stage  And I said   Wait a minute  this is no good   I want odd numbers  because of your center stage  if you have a    that means two people are in the middle  So I said   Make it    or make it nine  or I m not showing up   And generally they did it  because we were way ahead from the beginning  But I made a lot of great friends out of that group  and many of them are good friends today  Although you wouldn t know it based on the   they say that was the meanest   that was a pretty mean primary  you got to say  Wasn t that fun  I liked it  Through their depraved actions today  Crazy Nancy Pelosi s House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame  and it really is  It s a disgrace  Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president  They think that the Washington swamp  which we believe it or not  it ain t easy  because they got so much stacked  including these guys  You know what  These guys are apart of the Democrat Party  They are a part of it  You might as well call them Democrats  You know  it s owned by Commicast  They re just as bad as CNN  or they re just as bad as MSNBC  And by the way  CNN and MSNBC  their ratings are down the tubes  It s great  I love it  I love it  But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election  That s what they think  There s never been a time like this  Think of it  you have the greatest economy in the history of the world  Other countries come to see me  all of their leaders  and they say   Sir    first thing   Sir  congratulations on your economy  We re trying to do the same thing  Congratulations  sir   And these guys don t like talking about it  And if they do  they say   Obama did it  Oh  Obama  Obama   Remember Obama said   You will never be president  He will never be president   Then remember he said   I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president   And then I became president  He wasn t so happy  And in all fairness  he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary  because he had more strength  I mean  I go to these places  Secret Service  they take me  I haven t seen a lobby in three years  It s true  I go through basements  I pass compactor plants  I know more about compactors from this job  I don t see lobbies  I say  Fellows  you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby    No  sir   But I ll tell you what  I go upstairs  downstairs  all around  They re taking me up three flights  go down one  I said   Are we almost there    Yes  sir  another four flights   And I say   You think Hillary could do this  I don t think so   They d bring her back home  She wants to go to sleep  And now I hear she wants to run again  Wouldn t that be great  Oh  Thank you  Thank you  Oh would we love that  You think the Democrats are screwed up  Wait until that happens  Wouldn t that be   Oh  there s my guy  Lock her up  Lock her up  Lock her up  Well look  based on the FBI report  you just saw what happened with the IG  where they came out with the FBI  Based on that  you know what  I never stopped you  But now  think of what they did  Think of what they did  Think of how dishonest it all was  They shouldn t even be allowed to have an impeachment  because it was based on dishonesty  It was based on illegality  She went out  and they paid for a fake dossier  They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier  totally disproven  totally fake  The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign  And if we were Democrats  they would ve been in jail two years ago  It s a disgrace  Think of what they did  So they use this fake dossier  and they brought it before this big deal court  It s a big deal  the FISA Court  And they said this stuff  and they lied about it  because Comey  who s another beauty   did I do a great job when I fired his ass  What a great job  Oh no  they had bad plans  No  I did a great thing  That was like throwing a rock at a hornet s nest  Did that place explode  And then we learned about Lisa Page  and her wonderful lover  Peter Strzok  I love you Lisa  I love you more than anybody in the world  I love you more than anybody in the world  It causes problems with the wife  but we won t talk about that  Those tapes didn t work well  No  how about those statements  right  And then they say   In all fairness    I really liked the report  but how does the Inspector General say   because don t forget  he was appointed by Obama  So I m not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets  but we had a lot of those nuggets  How does the Inspector General say  You have these horrible   he s going to lose  Isn t he  He s going to lose  or she s going to win     million   Did you see all the zeros  It was like   I m blinking  I says   I think it s        He s going to lose     to one  Isn t he Peter  I love you so much  Peter  I ve never loved anyone like you  He s going to lose     million to one  Peter  right    That s right  He s going to lose     million to one   But there s no bias  How about the insurance policy  To me  the greatest  Just in case she loses  we have an insurance policy  We re in the insurance policy right now folks  We ve been in it for three years  that s what they meant  I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator  because we re doing awfully well  And I ll tell you something  Rush Limbaugh said it  Sean Hannity said it  Laura Ingram said it  Tucker said it  Ainsley said it  but a lot of people have said it  They said   There s nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened  and still created one of the greatest economies  and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years   I understand that  I understand that  but it s my life  very unfair to my family  I have to say this very  very unfair to my family  What they put my family through is a disgrace  Me  it s my life  It s fine  I do  But you know what  What they put my family through is a disgrace  and they ought to be ashamed  and we should get apologies all over the place  So yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party s outrageous abusive power  That s what it is  They have nothing  They re the ones that should be impeached  every one of them  I mean you got this guy  Schiff  He makes up a statement  and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity  and he makes up a statement from me that s totally fictitious  totally out of thin air  The worst statement I ve ever heard  Many people saw it  I had a person two weeks ago that said   I didn t love the statement you made  I said   Really  Didn t you read the transcripts   I always say   Read the transcript  But didn t you read it   No  no  I heard it on television  I watched Adam Schiff   He made it up  I then sent him the transcript  He said   Oh  now I feel better  That s perfect   I call it perfect  He called it perfect  Everyone calls it  if you read it  But here s the thing  He makes up this statement  and it finished  Didn t he have eight quid pro quos  Eight  Could you imagine  you re dealing with a country  and you say eight times that you ve got to do something  The first time they say   Well   The second time they say   That s strange   Third time they say   What s wrong   You said eight times  Eight times  They d have you arrested  They d have you put into an insane asylum  But he actually said   I think he said eight  not seven  eight  And then he finished with   Don t call me  I ll call you   Can you imagine  The President of the United States   Don t call me  I ll call you   You know what that is  That s a mafia statement  okay  That s the head of the mafia saying   Don t call me   This guy actually said that  and then he walked away and people became incensed  because they knew that wasn t the people that read the thing  Most people believed him  He s a liar  Because you know  he s a corrupt politician        No  he s a corrupt   and then I see him  By the way  you ever see this guy  He walks up to the mics  I mean  we re not   all fairness  look  I don t want to be   because with Me Too  I never even think about looks anymore  okay  I don t talk about looks of a male or a female  but in his case  let s just say   the last time I ll ever refer to this  He s not exactly the best looking guy we ve ever seen  No  any mic  He walks up to the mic  and he s so just   This is a sad  sad day for America  Our president is an employee of Russia  I have absolute proof that the president  this is at the beginning  and every week they d say  Where s the proof    It s coming  It s coming   Then we get the Mueller report  nothing  And I ll tell you what  I know some of the people in this audience  If I spent not     million  not    Trump haters  I call them the angry Democrats  It was     then it went to     and then Mueller  Did Muller do a good job  Did he do a good job  No  Boo  How was his performance in front of Congress  Boo  Not the best  but think of this      million they spent  And you know  I heard somebody say   Well  we got back some of that money   Let me tell you  you cost this country billions  and billions  and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn t get done  in all of the embarrassment to our country  You caused billions and billions of dollars  and it was a hoax  But this guy  Schiff   I have absolute proof  I have this  I have that  this  that   Anytime he sees a camera and he s stone faced  stone faced  He s a pathological liar  He gets up  and I ve never seen anything like it  Even I was saying   I wonder what he has  What does he have   He says   I have absolute  I said  I haven t spoken to Russia in year  What the hell do I have to do with Russia   But this guy gets up   oh  I think we have a vote coming in  Haleigh  Wow  Thank you  Haleigh  great job  Wow  The Republican party has never been so affronted  but they ve never been so united as they are right now  ever  never  And I know the senators  and they re great guys  and women too  We have some great women  We have great guys  They re great people  They love this country  They re going to do the right thing  They re going to do the right thing  So I said in my letter to Pelosi   I love that  You know  usually there s one  two  The Republicans  look  I ve said it for a long time  The Democrats are lousy politicians  they really are  They ve got horrible policies  open borders  crime is fine  drugs pouring through  I mean  think of what they do  Sanctuary cities  they love sanctuary cities  They re lousy politicians  but they have one thing   two things  They are vicious  They re the most vicious people  The Republicans aren t as vicious  They may learn to be vicious after going through this  though  But the other thing  the Democrats always stick together  Now think of it  three Democrats went over to our side  no Republicans  It s unheard of  And by the way  this is for a hundred years  I m not just talking about this little point in time  The Republicans are known as  it s always harder to stick together  These people are great  We have a great Republican Party  and we have to get that change  We have to take back the house  You ll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take   and by the way  we had another victory  The individual mandate  just a little while ago  it came over the wires  it was just upheld  The individual mandate is now gone  The most unpopular part of Obamacare  It was just upheld  So I said in my letter to Pelosi   By proceeding with your invalid impeachment  you re violating your oath of office  You re breaking your allegiance to the Constitution  You re declaring open war on American democracy  You dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme  yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America s founding  and your egregious conduct   And listen though  it s so true  it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged  and in fact their very lives to build   You are the ones interfering in America s elections  You are the one subverting America s democracy  We did nothing wrong  nothing whatsoever  This was just an excuse  You are the ones that are obstructing justice  You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish  personal  political and partisan gain   They re bringing pain  The work we could be doing on lowering drug prices  on getting rid of these horrible  horrible situations  You know in the border   the woman is okay  Is she okay  Okay  thank you very much  Thank you  I mean  some of these people are waiting here for three days  right  Thank you  They ll come back  Come back  Merry Christmas  Thank you  Merry Christmas is true  But what they ve done with this perversion  it s perversion  And when you watch some of these people get up and speak today  they don t even    You have violated the Constitution    Well  what does he done wrong    Well  we don t know that   They don t even have any crime  This is the first impeachment where there s no crime  I say   Tell me what I did  please    Well  we don t know  You violated the Constitution   You had Turley  who s smart  Alan Dershowitz  these guys  All of them  they said   There s no crime  There s no crime  right  There s no crime  There s no crime  I m the first person that ever get impeached  and there s no crime  I feel guilty  You know what they call it  Impeachment light  It s impeachment light  That s why  with Richard Nixon  I just see it as a very dark era  very dark  very   oh  you don t even like to think  I don t know about you  but I m having a good time  it s crazy  But I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party  we really do  Maybe I wouldn t feel the same way  but we have a great group of people behind us  We had in the House  and we have it in the Senate  They re doing a great job  so I m not worried  I m not worried  because it s always good when you don t do anything wrong  you get impeached  That may be a record that will last forever  But you know what they have done  They ve cheapened the impeachment process  And now anybody that become   this is a sacred position  Anybody that becomes president  I mean  they could have a phone call and they get impeached  So if the Republicans   if you had a Democrat as president  we have a Republican house  they don t like the guy for whatever reason  or the woman  they impeach the person  It s cheapened it  It s exactly what our founding fathers didn t want  and they said it could happen  and it s happened  But I know one thing  Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office  But it s so disappointing  I see a woman  Carolyn Maloney  She s a long time  nothing much  believe me  She s a Congresswoman from Manhattan  the east side  I was with her  Her first race  I helped her  She was always so nice  Oh  thank you  thank you   I made lots of contributions over the years  In New York  if you re not a   it s purely Democrat  especially in Manhattan  So what happens  I make lots of contributions for years  and years  and years  I go run  The first person I see  Carolyn Maloney  I raise my hand to impeach  Well  give me back the damn money that I ve been paying her for so many years  Let her pay me back all the money  Let her pay me back all the money  Then you have this Dingell  Dingell  you know Dingell  from Michigan  You know Dingell  You ever hear of her  Michigan  Debbie Dingell  that s a real beauty  So she calls me up like eight months ago  Her husband was here a long time  but I didn t give him the B treatment  I didn t give him the C or the D  I could ve  Nobody what is  you know  I gave the A  treatment   Take down the flags    While you re taking them down for ex Congressman Dingell     Oh  okay       do this  do that  do that  rotunda everything   I gave him everything  That s okay  I don t want anything for it  I don t need anything for anything  She calls me up   It s the nicest thing that s ever happened  Thank you so much  John would be so thrilled  He s looking down  He d be so thrilled  Thank you so much  sir   I said   That s okay  don t worry about it   Maybe he s looking up  I don t know  I don t know  Maybe  maybe  But let s assume he s looking down  But I gave him A   not A  not B   not B  I gave him the A   and she called me  She said   Oh  no   I won t go into the conversation  because it s not fair do that  But all I want to say is  let s put it this way  it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to     it was a     Okay  so that was what  February or something  Now they talk about this phony impeachment  and she s out there   Well  we have to look seriously at our president  because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States   Boo   And I can t be happy with that  because I love our country  I love this  and I love that   She loves everything  I said   She s a no  okay  No  but I look at her  and she s so sincere  and what happens  I vote to impeach Trump   And you know what  I didn t say   Who the hell knew this was even going to come up   I went through the whole Muller hoax  They did this big report  I was totally exonerated  They didn t even bring it up at the impeachment  because I was totally exonerated  If they saw one little kernel  one little quarter of a sentence   look what they did with one word  Remember this  what did I do  Why did I do  It s us  But they don t say it that way  They say   I   They read it totally different  schiff and his band of thieves  they read it  Now I say basically  very simple  do us a favor  our country  Do us  Do us  Not me  Our country  And then what do I say  I say   The United States Attorney General  Attorney General of the United States could speak to you  it would be great  okay  Because it s known for major corruption  In fact  the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction   on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty  and everything that was going on in Ukraine  right  He looked for it  that s how he got into office  He got into office that way  So we take it and they repeat it a thousand times  and they never say with the right   so I go wild  and we start  And the Republicans have got it right  Now we always correct him  but I use the word us  Us is the United States  our country  And then it actually says  I think  Comma  country  but they don t say that  They say  Do me a favor   How many times have you heard it  Where they say in a speech   And then the president said  do me a favor   Well  that s not what I said  I said   Do us a favor  our country   And then I said  the Attorney General of the United States  I didn t say my campaign  I said the Attorney General of the United States  I didn t say my campaign manager  Okay  I said the attorney   And these people want to impeach the President of the United States for that  Oh  and then what happened  Right  Then what happened  So then  the President of Ukraine  who s a quality person  said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  That was a killer for the Democrats  right  Then his foreign minister said the same thing  He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  There was no pressure  That s a killer  So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago  They tried to say that he s not a strong person  that he was weak  They used the word weak  that he was weak  and under the power of Trump  he said  Do you know how insulting that is  Anybody that becomes president of a country  and that s a big country and it s a tough country  you got to be tough  He s tough  But so what they re saying now is he was weak because the wording  it just doesn t fit  Okay  These are really dishonest people  And if the press was fair  this thing never would have happened  So the House Democrats are surrendering their majority  their dignity  their reputations  They look like a bunch of fools  And I ll tell you  we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party  I could read off a list of    names  But they re giving up their honor  and they ll receive a big backlash at the box office  When you take a look  that ballot box  that ballot box on November  rd  I think we re going to have crowds like we ve never had  And I ll tell you something  it used to be  they d always say   Oh  the Republicans   You know  in       I didn t run  I didn t run  right  They all said   Oh  we didn t   Well actually  we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about  We just approved     federal court justices      federal justices  including courts of appeal       We ll be up  probably by the end of the year  to      and for that  I thank President Obama  He gave me     openings  He gave me      I said to him  my people  I got there  because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court  We have two great Supreme Court judges  Right  Two Justices of the Supreme court  Kavanaugh  Gorsuch  Two great men  They re great  And how about the pain that they put Justice Kavanaugh through  right  Over a phony deal  I hate to tell you  Over a phony deal  What a disgrace  what they put that man through and that family through  Just remember it come November  You got to remember  it s a long time  You know  in the life of Trump     months is an eternity  It s a long time  Somebody said   Congratulations sir  you re going to win   I said   Don t say that  Just don t talk about it  Let s always pretend you re one point down   Like last time  Going to be close  Nope  it s going to be close  But what they put that man through was horrible  what they put his family through was horrible  And you know  those stories largely have been recanted  And frankly  the ones that didn t recant  I don t know what a Supreme Court judge does  but he should sue them  He should sue them  So we want to take back the House  we ll hold the Senate  and we ll keep the White House  You will have the greatest healthcare  You will continue with the greatest judges  You know  we have judges that are   We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal  I have to be always very truthful  because if I m a little bit off  they call me a liar  They ll say   He gets a Pinocchio  the stupid Washington Post  they have Pinocchio  I mean  even if you re saying things perfectly  it s a Pinocchio  There s nothing you can say where you don t get a Pinocchio  But what happens  what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story  They said  Whether you like him or not  the job he s done on judges and Supreme Court Justices  but the job he s done on judges is amazing  Say it s the most important thing  See  I don t agree  I say defense is the most  the military is the most  But once you re beyond the military  I mean to me defense is the most important  Because without good defense  maybe we don t need judges so much  right  It s like somebody said   Well  we violated the budget   I said   Do me a favor  don t worry about the budget  If we re attacked and aren t doing very well and somebody says   Well  at least we have a good budget   that doesn t work too well   Right  That doesn t work  So we have great military  we have great judges  we have great everything  Drug prices down  For the first time in    years  drug prices came down  And that was with no help from the Democrats  If they helped  because you need their votes  if they helped  I could get those drug prices down    and      Okay  And we just approved  and we re approving very soon for the Governor of Florida  Ron DeSantis  where he can buy  he has the right to go  we re giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country  where the prices for the identical drug  identical drug are     less  He s going to do that for the people of Florida  And we re going to do that for your governors if they want to do that  We ll get that down so far  Everyone in America can see straight through the Washington Democrats  phony  dangerous charade  Schiff makes up so many things  Pelosi makes it up  and she backs him up  I saw her on a television show  and George Stephanopoulos  that s another beauty  he said  even he said  he was defending me  I couldn t believe it  He made this statement   But you know he lied on that  He made up this stuff    No  he didn t  he didn t   So that means Nancy Pelosi said no  the statement that he made up  But it s all going to end soon  and it s going to come out to a beautiful  great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation  Thank you very much  So that s it  We have the greatest country  We ve turned around a ship  We need four more years  If we don t have it   Now  if you want to drive them crazy  we had one group in Pennsylvania  some guy started screaming       more years       They went crazy  And you know what they don t understand  When I do get out  they re all going to go out of business  They re making more money than they ve ever made  That crazy New York Times  one of the worst newspapers in the world  one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world  totally phony  They came out with a story  where it was a great headline for me  and the people that read it  the super radical left  they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story  Can you believe it  No  they re among the most dishonest people  But I ll never forget  before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady   Our First Lady is doing a great job  great job  I said   First Lady  you re so lucky I took you on this journey  this wonderful  beautiful journey   And it is  You know why it s a wonderful  beautiful journey  Because look at  what we re accomplishing is unbelievable  It s unprecedented  It is unprecedented what we re accomplishing   You re so lucky  I said it to all my people  I have great people in the back  I say  You folks are so lucky I took you on this  You could be home right now  relaxing   But I d rather be here  frankly  than any place  These rallies are great  They re inspiring  You are inspiring  And you know  it s funny  we re not even into election season  Yeah  it s a long way away  We re not even in it  And yet  I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the      election  Does that make any sense  I think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt  A lot of it has to do with the phony  witch hunt because you re smart people  You re the elite  They re not the elite  You re the elite  You re the elite  You do better than they do  They talk about it  don t you hate it   Well  the elite     Oh really  I went to better schools  Many of you went to better schools  We won t talk about homes  even though your homes are nicer  We won t talk about jobs  You see the jobs reports  You see what s happening  Do you see where wages are going up  You know  when I first started  when I was here  one of my first speeches  I was talking that people made more money  that was four years ago  so it was    years before that  so that s        years ago  They made more money    years ago than they were making when I got elected president  And they worked one job versus two or three jobs  Now it s going up beautifully and we want that  the salaries  And you know  the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker  It s percentage  the best  The blue collar worker  They had two and three jobs  The blue collar worker is going up the most  Anyway  so you know what else  The thing I m happiest about  African American unemployment  the lowest in the history of our country  African American  Remember I used to say  you remember  look at  you  Are you the greatest guy  Everyone thinks  do I pay  I m telling you  I have a group of African American guys  and gals by the way  that follow me around and they think I pay them  and I don t  I love them  they love me  They come  How many rallies have you come to  A lot  They re great people  just great  Thank you  I don t even know who the hell he is  Is that right  I don t know him  but I like him  I see him at so many rallies  I appreciate it  You and your group  they re great people  Thank you  So you re obviously doing well if you can travel around like that  right  Ah  he knows  I appreciate it  I really do  I think it s fantastic  Thank you  Thank you  But think of this  African American unemployment is the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country  Their poverty levels  they had a horrible poverty level  in the negative sense  now their poverty levels are the best they ve ever been in the history of our country  Same with Hispanic Americans  the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers  And the same with Asians  the best unemployment  And women  I m sorry     years  best in    years  I ve let the women down  But I think within another couple of months  you ll be historical  So only    years best  The best in    years  But what we re doing has been an incredible thing  It s an incredible thing  When I m on the debate stage with one of these characters  and they try and say negative stuff  I ll just say   Well  here s the story  In the history of our country  this group is doing the best  and that group is doing the best  and the women are doing the best  and everybody s doing  And frankly  you know what it is  The whole country s doing the best  Okay  The whole country is doing the best   So we have records and everything  and yet they re trying to  and they really are  I ve never seen anything like it  they re accusing me  really  of doing what Joe Biden   Biden admitted what he did  How about this  They protect him  Did you see the crummy debate  Those debates are so boring  They re dying in the ratings  They re dying  they re dying    While it s totally unsupported   What s unsupported  He s on tape saying that he s holding back    billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor  How about that question  I won t say who answered  because you know I m not  I actually used to like the guy  he was a nice guy to me  but now I don t like him so much  but that s okay  But he goes   While it s totally unsubstantiated  and while we beg your mercy that we re asking you even to bring up this question  but President Trump said you refused to give    billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son s company   And Sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer  and that s the end of it  That s it  Then whenever I bring it up  do you ever notice they always use    While these charges are totally unsubstantiated   He s on tape  If that were me  it s the electric chair  They would bring the electric chair back  No  the guy s on tape  and they always say it s unsubstantiated   It is not supported by fact  one of them the other day  they finally changed the word  It is supported by fact   No  it s supported by tape  No  it s unbelievable  In many ways  I d like to have him win because number one  he s going to have to eventually answer that question  and number   She said he doesn t know where he is  That s the other problem  Now  I ve been doing this for a long time  and I have much bigger crowds than anybody s ever had in history  By the way  do you know what  I say it against the fake news  because you know what they re going to say  Every stadium is packed  I give my people one instruction  get the largest stadium you can get  Now  that s why I was a little surprised  But in Battle Creek  you don t have that many  right  Not too many stadiums  But I wanted to be here  You know why I wanted to be here  First of all the crowd is incredible  The crowd outside  But let me tell you  No  you know why I wanted to be here  Because we have a lot of choices  but I wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly  and I said   I want to be there   Pretty simple  pretty simple  Pretty simple  I wanted to be here for that reason  and I just want to say thank you  because I ll tell you what  you came in   I don t know  I didn t get       but we got a damn good percentage  right  We got a damn good percentage  So it s really thrilling to be here  But we re joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders  Your Michigan House Speaker  Lee Chatfield  Where s Lee  Lee  come up if you want  Come on  what the hell  we have nothing else to do  Should we get him up  Yes  Come up Lee  come up Lee  get up here  Come on up  Lee  Republican Party Chairwoman  Ronna McDaniel  who I spoke to  And the bottom line on the end of her story  so when I won I said   Who s going to head up the RNC   I said   I got to get that woman from Michigan   Remember they were all saying   You can t win Michigan   Now we re going to win it by so much  you better remember all those  Every time a car plant opens  please think about Trump  Come on up here  Lee  Michigan GOP Chairwoman  Laura Cox  Thank you  Hate to tell you  but all your congressmen  you know where they are right now  Your congressmen  all of your Congresspeople  men  wonderful people  they re at a place called Congress right now  They re doing an unbelievable job of supporting your President and supporting you  They had a choice   Sir  should we leave and be there   I said   Don t leave  Stay right where you are   That s why we got that vote  That s some vote  right Lee  The Chairman of the Woman s Workers and Workers for Trump  and a proud union autoworker  Terry Bowman  who s been so terrific  Thank you  Terry  Come on up  And while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment  we re focused on jobs  jobs  jobs  This group  local leaders  And all your Washington folks  they are right where they have to be in Washington tonight  Thank you  Thank you  Great job  Thank you very much  We ve eliminated more job killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country  whether it s four years or eight years  or in one case  much more than eight years  In a period of two and a half years  we have eliminated more regulations than any other president  by far  You re saving almost        a year because of regulation cuts  Total income gains for median households will reach         a family  I ll give you a couple of quick numbers  So under President Bush  for eight years  you saved       meaning you took in     bucks  Okay  fine  Under President Obama  you took in       Under President Trump  including the energy savings  and the regulation savings  and the tax cut savings  it s more than         in less than three years  Pretty good  right  So for two eight years  you had a     450  and a      That s eight years       In less than three years  you had more than          That goes right into your pockets  It s one of the reasons our economy is doing well  because  as they say  the consumer is doing better than they ve ever done  And that s great  that s what we wanted  We ve ended the war on American energy  and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth  And these maniacs want to close it up  How about going to Texas  You know Beto  What  Remember what he said  I said   Oh  this guy s a loser  You know a salesman  like if you re a great salesman  you never talk that you re a great salesman  You don t walk in and say   Well  I m a great salesman  I can sell     Any guy that does that  they re no good  It s those quiet type that get you  You know  the ones that don t talk  So Beto  when he first got in  remember this clown  He gets in  no  no  he gets in   I was made for this job  to run for president   After about two weeks  they killed him  He was gone  But you remember  he was against the Bible  he was against religion  he was against guns  and he was against oil and gas  And he comes from Texas  I said  that s a platform  Think of it  He s against religion  he s against guns  and against oil and gas  Think of it  I don t like to bring it up because he s gone zone  but he comes from Texas  I said   Abraham Lincoln can t win in Texas with that platform   But they are  all of them  they want to close up your energy  It s a big deal  They want to close up your steel mills  They don t want your steel mills  Look at what I ve done for steel  I mean  the steel is back  We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places  and your steel mills that are doing great  they re expanding all over the country  And they were going to be out of business within two years  The way they were going  they were gone  United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions  Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U S  auto industry forever  And you know why  Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric  I want to have an alternative  a big alternative  You re going to always have the alternative  And a lot of people don t know of the electric can ever catch the gas  you know  And by the way  there ll be different forms of energy coming along  But they want to close them up  and we re not closing them up  We re going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing  you can have it for a lot of different reasons  We re even bringing back the old light bulb  You heard about that  right  The old light bulb  which is better  I say   Why do I always look so orange   You know why  Because of the new light  they re terrible  You look terrible  They cost you many  many times more  like four or five times more  And you know they re considered hazardous waste  When a light bulb is out  you ve got to bring it to a dump  So let s say  over here in Battle Creek  where s your nearest dump  Okay  that s what  a couple of hundred miles away  So every time you lose   drive a couple of hundred miles  right  I said   How many people do that   Nobody  What do they do  They throw it in the garbage  But you know what it is  because it s all gas  It s much more expensive  four or five times more  And I came into office  I did a lot of this  Sinks  showers  all of this stuff  I did a lot of it  No water comes out  You have areas where there s so much water  you don t know what to do with it  You turn on the shower  you re not allowed to have any water anymore  I mean  we do a lot of it  Dishwashers  we did the dishwasher  right  You press it  Remember the dishwasher  you d press it  boom  there d be like an explosion  five minutes later you open it up  the steam pours out  the dishes  Now you press it    times  the women tell me   Again   You know  they give you four drops of water  and they re in places where there s so much water  they don t know what to do with it  So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers  We re going back to the old  By the way  by the time they press it    times  you spend more on water  and electric  Don t forget  the whole thing is worse because you re spending all that money on electric  So we re bringing back standards that are great  and better machinery that you can have the water again  right  But with the light bulb  I said   What s going on with the light bulbs  A lot of people are complaining about the cost   So I had a couple of experts come in  I said   Tell me  what gives a better light    Well  we liked the old light bulb better   I said   I like it better   And so what I did is you can have either one  If you want to buy the newer kind  you can  And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind  like I do  So we re bringing back the old light bulb  So it s a much less expensive  it probably gives a better light  But whatever it is  and you ll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb  I mean  it sounds like little  but it s big stuff  Okay  It s big stuff  and we re doing it with a lot of other things  our dishwashers  And you know  I won t tell you one of the things  because every time I tell you  they do a big number on it  You know the one I m talking about  right  Sinks  right  Showers  And what goes with a sink and a shower     times  right     times  Not me  of course  not me  but you  him  But I never mention that  because one time I mentioned all three  I said   Sinks  showers  and toilets   The headline was   Trump with the toilets  toilets   That s all they want  They don t even mention it  So I didn t mention that  okay  I go off the record  But you know what  It s terrible  You want to wash your hands  you turn on the sink  no water comes out  So you leave the water going    times as long  it s the same thing  You have a shower  drip  It s no good for me  For me  You know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business  They always used to say I wore a hairpiece  It s okay  I know people wear hairpieces  But they always used to say  They don t say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms  If you wear one of those suckers  you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you  You look handsome  don t worry about it  But in the last two decades before my election  we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country  The people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they ve wanted to do for so many years  And that s why it doesn t work  We look so forward to taking it on  and it is all about cleaning the swamp  draining the swamp  and we have a very  very big  bad  dangerous swamp  Okay  that s enough of that  That s enough  So among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the U S  auto industry  I withdrew from the horrible Trans Pacific Partnership  That would have ended your auto industry  A lot of people don t know that  but I do  Remember TPP  We were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off  The people that made these trade deals  it s like  where do they come  Like the one in Korea  that was a Hillary Clinton special  She said   This will produce         new jobs   And I said   Well  what happened   He said   Well  she was right   Except it was for South Korea  not for us  No  it s true  It produced         jobs for South Korea  These deals were so bad  But now they re getting really good  and some of them are getting great  and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal  Wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time  But we have to go through a little pain  because we have to do it  and then they all say   We re going to withdraw  and then I say  You can withdraw  I don t care  We re putting tariffs on your country   Then they say   We d love to make a deal  sir   The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong  Since the election  we ve created        brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs  manufacturing jobs  Remember the statement by President Obama   You d have to wave a magic wand   Remember the magic wand  Because manufacturing   And I said   You know  that sounds strange  What do you do if you don t have manufacturing  How do you make things   Right  Manufacturing jobs won t happen  Well  we ve got         manufacturing jobs  and you re going to see a big  big increase  The truth is  we need more people  You know what  We need more people  We need more people coming into the country  and they re going to come in  and they re going to come in through merit  and they re going to love our country  and they re going to respect our country  and they re going to work  We do need more people  They re opening these massive  Foxconn in Wisconsin  they re opening these massive plants and it s hard to get people  We want people coming in  but they have to come in  only they have to come in through merit  Fiat Chrysler recently announced a      billion investment in Michigan  including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation  And General Motors recently announced a      million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant right here in Michigan  Come on  General Motors  let s go  General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building  I wasn t happy about that  That was the only building I had a problem within the whole car industry  right  Right  You know the one I m talking about  I didn t like that  Anyway  but they re spending money  you know  what can I tell you  But these companies are coming in  a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to  I say   You have to  or we re not trading with you anymore   Because we had such big deficits with these countries  With Japan  we had a     billion deficit  I said  Shinzo  he s great Prime Minister of Japan  But he said   But nobody has ever asked us to do this   I said   I m asking you   They are building many  many plants  They re building many plants now in the United States  the Japanese  And after years of rebuilding foreign nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  Is that okay  We were surrounded with globalists  You know  they think it s okay  You open a plant in some country that you never heard of  they make your product  they send it  In the meantime  they close all their factories here  We re not doing that anymore  Those are globalists  They think it s wonderful to have deficits  I don t  They think it s great  It s a great thing to have deficits  No  those are globalists  The globalists are passe   our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you  the American people  before anybody else  We must care for our own  We must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans  I don t even know what s happening  It s terrible  And we ve moved out thousands and thousands of MS   thugs out of our country  And we have agreements now with Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador  They didn t use to take them back  If we had a murderer  then we should get them the hell out  We don t really want them in our prisons and take care of them for        years  We want to bring them back  They wouldn t take them  The planes used to go around and around  don t land  don t land  With us  they land  We worked out deals with every one of them  We stopped giving them all the aid  We re giving them all this money and then they said   We re not going to let you land  We re not going to let you take them back   I said   That s okay      million  we were giving them  I said  now we give them    we give them nothing  All of a sudden they said   We would love to have them back   We would love it  It s wonderful to have them back  In June  two illegal aliens in Sandusky  Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife  Then  they hid her body in a water drain  A criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death  a single mother of five young children  It s happening all the time  Far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities  which deliberately release dangerous  violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets  We had a great election in North Carolina recently  two great congressmen got elected  you don t hear about it  when they win  you don t ever hear about it  just a few months ago  Two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I went in and said   Talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities  and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities  Soon as I mentioned that  boom  they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great  Great thing  The sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you  the people of California  they don t like sanctuary cities either  They re stuck with them because they have crazy politicians  Earlier this year  authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County  Michigan  anybody know Kent County  Released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle  They let him go to roam free in Michigan communities  If you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan  if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens  if you want to have a safe life  frankly  it s so crazy what they re doing  You wouldn t even believe it  You have only one choice in       you must vote Republican  Thank you  I m surprised  As you know  you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan  I was almost surprised to hear it  but you have them  It s one of those progressive things  They think they re doing a wonderful favor for the world  And now we re getting these prosecutors that  you murder somebody  they give you two months  they fight that you don t even have to go to jail  What s going on is crazy  Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  illegal crossings are down     since may and we ve ended catch and release  We ve ended it  We could ve ended it so easily  It s called the loophole  You catch him and then you release him into a country  That s what you had to do by law  And if you don t do that  they arrest the border patrol people  You believe this  The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people  These are the people because look  when you have a caravan of eight or        people  a lot of those people  do you think that Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador  do you think they re sending us their finest  I don t think so  Alright  How about the lottery  That was a Schumer deal  Chuck Schumer  crying Chuck  crying Chuck Schumer  I used to be a big contributor to him  he used to kiss my ass  Chuck Schumer  He d do anything  He would ve done anything for me  Anything I asked him  get Schumer on the phone   You do this  you do that  You get him on the phone  that son of a bitch   He would have done  I didn t need anything  but he would have done anything  Now it s like   The prisoner has not acted    Give me a break  Give me a break  Find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck  give all that money back please  Carolyn Maloney  give that money back  Every penny should come back  They act so pompous  They act so righteous  They re not righteous  They re not righteous  They re bad people  The far left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now  Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor      million people are going to lose  A lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that s phenomenal  And that s what you want  They want to take it away       They want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night  I don t think so  Not in this group  And you know what  Some people  it s good so people  but can you imagine  They want to take away     million people  great  private  highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor  Remember Obama     times   You can have your doctor  you can have your plan   Didn t work out that way  did it  I think we should impeach him for that  Let s impeach him  for that  for the IRS scandal  for the guns  Remember the guns  he was giving them to anybody that wanted them  He gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn t have them registered  right  Not to good  Impeach him  Why didn t the Republicans impeach him  Those were really  how about giving around      billion in cash  How about that  By the way  I ended the Iran nuclear deal  I hope you happy  much different country  But how about giving Iran      billion in cash  Many big planes going over to Iran  loaded up to the ceiling with cash  You know what      billion  you ever see like at a casino     million wrapped up  It s a big pile of stuff  that s a million  Now multiply it       billion in cash he gave  So  why is he allow to do that  Did anybody try to impeach him for that  Everybody knew it was wrong  Republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians  Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother s womb  right up until the moment of birth  Right  That is why I ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God  Democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  And that s what it is  The Republican party is the party of the American worker  the American family  and the American dream  And that s really what it is  We re also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln  A lot of people forget that  but we have to bring it up  To protect the health and safety of our citizens  we awarded      million to improve water infrastructure in Flint  How badly was Flint  Who were the geniuses that did that to you  You have clean water coming into Flint  They had to pay a very tiny little fee  So instead  they go into this horrible  horrible  really polluted water and the water comes out of there  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks  and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people  It hurt the people  But we re getting it fixed  And I know your previous governor was a Republican  but I was not a big fan of his  I was not  but I m not a big fan of the one that can t fix the potholes either  We re committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth  and that s what it s about  It s about clean air and it s about clean  beautiful water  And it s about keeping our industry  not closing it because of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord  How s Paris doing  I don t think too well  How s Paris doing with the yellow vests  The yellow vests  You know why  Because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in France never heard of  It s not working out too well  We re lowering prices  We re lowering taxes  We re making it possible  I mean  look at gas prices now  Look at gas prices  I recognize Israel s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem  And we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Big deal  For years  you watched as your politicians apologized  Member   I would like to apologize  I would like to apologize   Nah  we don t apologize  Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan  You re getting your auto industry back  At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation  If you want your children to grow up  a land of safety  it s really  we want a land of safety  justice  Well  I don t know  When I look at those FBI reports we got out  we got to clean up a lot  What they ve done to hurt people  what they ve done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people  what they ve done to hurt people  I think one of the best things I did as president  a lot of people would say   With all what we ve done for the economy and  but one of the best things is firing James Comey s ass out of there  Boy  those reports are kept  Did you see the other day  Well  ah  ah   First time now he said  in other words  he s     there folks  He s hit the golden pond  Anyway  so what we re doing is  we re doing things that are going to make our victory  it s like a tree  We need that extra four years  We ve done so much  even Right to Try  You know Right to Try  People were traveling  they re terminally ill  they re traveling all over the world  We have the best medical in the world  the best doctors  the best labs  best hospital  They re traveling all over the world  to try and get  because it takes years to get something approved  And I said   Wait a minute folks  why aren t we doing this   And they ve been trying to do it for    years  They couldn t get it done  Not that easy  The drug companies didn t want the liability  the country didn t want the liability  the insurance companies didn t want the liability  I said   Here s what we do  We ll sign an agreement with the people where you re exculpated from all liability    Huh  That s a good idea   And it s a very strong agreement so we can t get sued  But I said   Listen  they were worried they re going to hurt people   I said   These people are terminally ill  They re terminally ill  and so we do it now   Nine months ago  all the legislators at the    years  so if somebody s sick  they don t have to go to Asia  they re have to go to Europe  Or if you re poor  you go home and you die  Now what happens  Very simple  You sign that document  they work it out  You wouldn t believe how many lives are being saved  It s incredible  It s incredible  I m very proud of it  Right to Try  I hope you don t need it  You don t want it  You don t want it  Okay  But if you do  it s there  With your help  we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  We will enact the greatest trade deals ever made  They ll result in more products  proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  made in the USA  We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  What we re doing is unbelievable  We re so far ahead of everybody  What we ve done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of what we re doing  it would take    13     years to get things approved  It s down to a much smaller number  but we re finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America  We ve started the process  Who would ve thought that  In    years  it s a    year process  we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been been started before I came to office  It was just wasted time  We will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  Above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America  We support  protect and defend the constitution of the United States  We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  They re incredible  and that includes ICE  You know how tough these people are  These are great patriots  They love our country  Even the sheriffs alone for  some of the people that they re dealing with  These guys walk into the golem s nest and in some cases they just swing it out  They can have it  They love it  These are great  If we didn t have them  and I told you before  they re taking out bad  bad  bad people by the thousands  especially MS   gang members  Who s going to do that  Who s going to do that  Anybody in the front row  I don t know  What about you  You re a tough guy  You might do it  You could do it  I don t know  You might  yeah  you can  What you like  We re going to recruit you  I think you could handle yourself  Now  these are tough people  right  You got to be tough  Then they get accused  they re too tough  Oh  they re too tough  You have some of these guys  They knife people  They don t even need a gun because it s more painful  They knife the two young girls     years old  Beautiful  They cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them  These are animals  And then Nancy Pelosi said  I shouldn t use the term animal  And by the way  she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the Pacific ocean and into their beaches  She ought to go and take care of her district in San  Do you see what s going on  And it rains and it s filth and it s needles and it s drugs and it s  you know what  It s everything and it goes right into those storm sewers  Storm  not sanitary  storm and it goes right out into the Pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine Los Angeles and San Francisco  but we ve just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they re doing  And Nancy Pelosi is playing games  She ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything  San Francisco was the most beautiful city  When you look at what s happened with the tents all over the place  where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat  they re getting sick  Diseases are coming back that this world hasn t seen for    40     years  It s a disgrace  She ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense  We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  We believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy are the true American way  We believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great American flag  And we live by the words of our national motto and it s always going to be up there  They want to take everything down  They don t want Thomas Jefferson anymore  They don t want anything  That s a terrible thing and we fight for it  now  We fight  These words will never be taken off  I don t care where I am  If I m up there  if I m down here  I don t know  but we ll be fighting  We ll never take these words off  in God we trust  We stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood  sweat and tears for this beloved nation  This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line  It s the place where General Motors  Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation  It gave us Motown  the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest  This is the American mid west  And Michigan is the state where generations of strong  tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world  And we are making it bigger  better and stronger than ever before  by far  Loyal citizens like you help build this country  And together  we are taking back our country  We are returning power to you  The American people  the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted  but with us  you will never be forgotten again  The forgotten men and women of this country will never  ever be forgotten again  And I m fighting for you  And I love doing it with everything that I have  And I will never  ever stop  And you know that  I will say I could have a much easier life  Some people say   Why is he doing it   You know why I m doing it because we re doing the thing and look what we re doing is we re bringing back our country again  We re respected again  we re respected again  We are so respected  you don t even know how respected  I went to NATO where we were being ripped off because the other countries  you have    countries  and the other countries weren t paying their bills  They were delinquent in real estate  I noticed people are using that word  I ve been using it for the last year  It s like a real estate trend  That s when they don t pay their rent  right  Well  they weren t paying and you have to see this chart  until I got there  They got to pay and they said   Well  does that mean you won t protect us   I said   You don t want the answer to that question   Over the last  and the Secretary General Stoltenberg  over the last period of just two years  I raised  not from us  nothing from us       billion  but that s nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying      billion more  All of those countries  My biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO  He says   I never thought this could   I m telling you  if you look  it s like    years just down  President Obama would go there  make a speech   I d like to thank everybody for being here  Thanks  Look  great job  Sayonara  Goodbye   Bush  they all did  Nobody ever asked for money  We were spending for      of NATO  We re protecting Europe  They rip us off on trade  right  They rip us off like crazy  We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade  We re changing that  but it s a long time  It s been going on a long time  They don t take your product  They don t take your cars  They don t take your farm product  They don t take your medical machines  We do a big business  They sell us  We don t sell them because they put restrictions  We have better equipment than them  but they make it so that our equipment doesn t qualify  It s called artificial barriers or non monetary barriers  It s brutal what they do  I m telling you  they re as bad as China  just smaller  They are as bad as China  just smaller and now China s doing great  We re very happy  but we have to do something with that  We have to take care of our people  We can t be ripped off by these countries  so NATO is ripping us off militarily  but now they re starting to pay big money and that s good  We want to help them  We want to be there with them  but they have to pay  They have to pay       billion and the fake news doesn t even want to talk about it  They don t want to talk about it  They talk about other things  They don t want to talk about that  When you d get a chance though  just a couple of weeks  maybe you could say over a short period of time  NATO countries will be paying      billion more  More  not total  More  How s that  Good  That s not too bad  Nobody else could do that  I guarantee  I won t tell you what took place in those closed door meetings  Some of them don t like me  They like Obama  Germany likes Obama  A lot of these countries  France  they like Obama  It s embarrassing  In France  President Obama is more popular than President Trump  Well  I should be  I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they re ripping us off on the internet  Okay  If I ever become more popular  that means I m not doing my job  You should say he s out  It s true  I could be loved in Germany  I could be loved in Germany  Oh  they d love me  My father came from Germany  parents and I could be loved in Germany  They d like me so much  but then I m not doing my job for you  Have to do it  Have to do it  With your help  your devotion  your drive  we re going to keep on working  We re going to keep on fighting  We are going to keep on winning  winning  winning because we are one movement  one people  one family and one glorious nation  under God  America is thriving like never before  And ladies and gentlemen of Michigan  the best is yet to come  Great state  Great state  You better remember all those jobs in a year from now  I tell you  I ll say   That state let me down   I don t think that s going to happen  I m hearing very good thing  You know the interesting thing  before it was like a promise  I said I m going to bring car back  I m going to bring this  I m going to be pres  it was all like  it s good  You believed me  I was successful  all this  but now we ve done it  We have done more than I promised  no politics  I promised  we ve done more than we promised  No politician I think  has ever done that  Together we will make America wealthy again  We will make America strong again  We will make America proud again  We will make America safe again and we will make America great again  Thank you  Thank you  Michigan  Thank you '",

What a victory we had in Michigan  What a victory was that  One of the greats  Was that the greatest evening  But I m thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas  the greatness of America and the glory of God  Thank you very much  And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again  Did you notice  Saying Merry Christmas  I remember when I first started this beautiful trip  this beautiful journey  I just said to the First Lady   You are so lucky  I took you on this fantastic journey  It s so much fun  They want to impeach you  They want to do worse than that   By the way  by the way  by the way  it doesn t really feel like we re being impeached  The country is doing better than ever before  We did nothing wrong  We did nothing wrong  And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we ve never had before  Nobody s ever had this kind of support  But this sacred season  our country is thriving and it s thriving truly like it has never  it has never happened before to the extent what s happening now  And by the way  your state  because of us  not because of local government  but because of us  because of the job that we ve done  Because I understand she s not fixing those potholes  That s what the word is  It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you  We don t want to do that  But she s not fixing the potholes  But Michigan s had the best year it s ever had  Best year it s ever had  And that s because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they re coming in from Japan and they re coming in from a lot of other places  Look what s happening  And you know  I don t know if you know this  but probably    years ago I was honored  I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody  whoever  I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan  Can you believe it  Long time  And that was long before I ever decided to do this  I was happy  I had a beautiful life  What the hell did I do this for  But look how we re doing  Do we love it  I love it  But anyway  I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to    years ago and I came to Michigan  He said   You re still the Man Of The Year   Thank you  Who said that  Thank you  So I came in and I remember the speech so well  I said   Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies  Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China  they build them in China  they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs  you lose your factories  the companies leave and you get nothing  Why are they lying   I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it  We ve stopped it  And you see that  And we just made the USMCA  We re getting rid of NAFTA  which I think is the worst trade deal ever  And it s very exciting  It s a great deal  It s a great deal  It s going to stop exactly what we were just talking about  It makes it very  very prohibitive  They can do it  but they ve got to pay a hell of a big price to do it  And history has proven that stops them  But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico  with Canada  Now  from the standpoint of the farmers  you know what s going on  We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada  We had attacks on dairy products       tariff  nobody talked about it  with Canada  And we had some really bad things with Mexico  We now have a wonderful deal  And if we didn t have a good deal  you know what I would have done what  What  I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it  right  That would have been it  Unfortunately the deal s been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened  And she had a lot of pressure  especially from manufacturing areas  farm areas  a lot of pressure to sign it  So here s what happens  So I get along with labor  I had a lot of union labor vote for me  tremendous amount of labor  In New York where I come from  we have a lot of unions  And that s okay  That s fine  So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed  we ll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal  And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that s okay  Whatever it takes  For seven months  it sits  They don t do anything  We give  And by the way  I spoke to the unions the day before I say   Fellows  you got to get it done   And union labor loves me and I love you too sir  I love you too sir  So we have a great deal with Mexico  with Canada  And it is true  I say it out loud because I say it to them right now  If they ever wanted to break the deal  that s okay  If somebody wants to break a deal with me  you always have to have an alternative  right  And this country  the deals we made  we did a deal with South Korea  That s great  We did a deal with Japan     billion dollar deal with Japan  It was just a little piece of a deal  Okay  That was a piece of a deal  And I said to Japan   Look  you got to make this deal or we re going to put a     tariff on the cars  And that s more money than anything we re talking about   That s all right  That s all right  That s all right  Get her out  Ger her out of here  Oh well  You re about to hear the greatest speech you ve ever heard  And that s going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot  Massive riots  Fake news  But seriously  look  look  look  they won t say it  They won t say it  because when we have protesters all in favor  they don t talk about it  but there s a slob  There s a real slob  Wait  wait a minute  She ll get hell when she gets back home with mom  But she made  Look  she screams a little bit  And you know what I like to do  Avoid them  Because I ll tell you the big problem  I could hardly hear her  What happens is all of you people go crazy  Look  look  look  and the place  Okay  so there s one disgusting person who made  Wait  wait  who made a  I wouldn t say this  but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right  Now they won t say that  the fake news  they won t say it  If one of us did that  it would be like the biggest story ever  I think it s terrible  And I ll tell you the other thing  I don t know who the security company is  but the police came up  but they want to be so politically correct so they don t grab her wrist lightly and get her out  They say   Oh  would you please come  Would you please come with me   Sure   Ma am  would you   And then she gives the guy the finger and he   Oh  Oh   You got to get a little bit stronger than that  folks  And they    Making another group of tariffs  seven and a half percent  This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal  which they want to start  but we re taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted     billion and    billion the previous year  helps the farmers  So you know what we do  out of that big check that we get  all that money flows into the treasury  Out of the big check  we gave the farmers    billion dollars and    billion for the previous year  And you know  the incredible thing  and I was with a lot of farmers  I was with a group of    farmers at the White House  You know what they said to me  I said   Don t worry about it  We re going to take care of you guys   And I used a bad word  You know what word I used  We re going to get you a subsidy  And they said this two years ago  I said   How much were you targeted for   This was the first year      billion  sir   The second year was     They were target  That s what they didn t get from China  So I said   It s all right  we re going to give you a subsidy of the same and we re going to take it out of the tariffs and we re going to have billions and billions of dollars left over   And they said   Sir  we don t want money  We just want a level playing field   I ve never seen that before  I ve never seen that before  So we will have invested in our military  since I m here  which is less than three years  Our military  by the way  in all due respect to the previous two administrations  our military was depleted  It was depleted  It was in bad shape  We had fighter jets that were    years old  We had planes that were    years  You heard where the father flew them  the grandfather flew them  and now the young son comes in  We ve got the best equipment in the world now  Spent two and a half trillion dollars  made in the USA  Two and a half trillion  We will shortly  That ll be all finished  We re going to have the greatest  Now we have the best planes  We re going to have the best ships  We re building a lot of ships now  We re building the most powerful weapons in the world  Now  we don t want to even talk about it  We never want to use them  But you know  the way we re not going to have to use them is if we have them  We re building submarines  the power of which nobody s ever seen before  Nobody s ever seen before  It s funny  we have these companies come in  I like to make good deals  You like to make good deals  That s what we do  right  So these really countries that come in  prime ministers  presidents  sometimes dictators  those we can t deal with too much   Sir  we d like to buy a nuclear submarine   I say   No thanks   I turn them all down  You have no idea how many people  But we re building some of the  They re the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind  I say mankind and womankind  They can definitely fight  They re the real deal  These guys  so good looking  I said   You could be a movie star  Go to Hollywood    No sir  I like doing what I m doing   So I said to these guys  you going to see  just like central casting  I said  I said   Fellas  how good is this plane   They said   Sir  it s great    Why    Because the enemy can t see it   That helps  Stealth  It s actually called super stealth  So I said   You mean they can t see  so you shoot at them but they can t   He said   They have no idea where we are  sir   I said   That sounds good to me   Nobody does it  Nobody can do it  We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes  we bought in a lot of great stuff  And I won t tell you the story  but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace  and one of the generals came up to me and said   Sir  don t go  Don t do it    Why    We don t have the ammunition   And I said two things  I never want to hear a President  Right  We never want to have a President hear that again  nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then  But  another thing we did  which to me is such an incredible thing to have done  It s such an honor  So our last US Armed Forces  the last branch was the Air Force  right  That was many  many decades ago  We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces  The Space Force  So I ll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else   See that Space Force  That was my baby   And you think that was easy  That s not easy  Because you have Democrats that do not like our military  They do not like our military  And we did something yesterday  because for three years I would see people that run  Incredible people  the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country  And every year they d come in and they d be looking for help  They needed help and they do need help with it and it s great and they do an incredible job  So many great schools  but they need help  And every year they d have to come and come  I got to know them actually  I said   The only bad thing is you won t see me too much anymore   Because we just provided record funding for a nation s Historically Black Colleges and Universities  And it s longterm  they re not going to have to come  So I said   Look  we could do it where we do it every year or we ll do what we have  What do you want   They said   Let us just have it   So we ll miss them  But they are great people  They ve done an incredible job  And our extraordinary jobs boom  which created another         jobs last month  and then you add the undercount from the previous two months  you re close to         jobs  And they said  if you re a business watcher which I am  I love watching business  but they said they were guessing  could be    0  could be    0  maybe     maybe      somebody said  Then the number comes out 266     with an adjustment  Remember about four months ago when we had one little period  right  We had one little period where there was a little downturn  They said   Oh  Oh  we think we re going into a recession   I said   Don t worry about it    We think we re going into a recession   They were willing to lose their wealth  They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own  what do you guys own back there  Let it go  They ll go bust  They don t care  Anything to get rid of us  Not me  us  And you know what  Then all of a sudden  and now for the last couple of weeks  we ve set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets  So  as of yesterday  we ve had     record days in the stock market now  and that s in less than three years  So when I see that I don t care because I don t  I m not allowed to have stock  I can t have stock  They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand  I agree  I can  But you know what  I ll tell you what  What I see  I see tremendous job growth because we re setting records  But you know what I also see  The    ks where people are up      they re up      they re up      I tell you the story all the time  I mean  I have people coming up to me  and a man came up  a policeman  I ve told this story  but I ve had many  so many times  but this guy in particular  because it was early and that was a year ago  That was a long time ago  Right now it s much higher than that  But he said   Sir  I want to thank you  My wife thinks I m a loser  All my life  we never did well with the    ks  with stocks  Everything I invested  I m up      sir  She thinks I m a financial genius  She s so in love with me  She so in love   He said   She said   Darling  I think you re one of the greatest investors  Why don t you do this professionally   And I don t even know what I m doing  sir  I just have all these stocks   So I just wanted to tell you  I look at a    k  who has    ks here  So that s what I see  I don t care about the rich ones  I care about everybody  I care  I care about everybody actually  Ford motor company just announced that it is investing     billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area  creating another      Michigan jobs  And that s on top of the many other investments we ve gotten from Japanese companies  car companies  and other companies  But they re all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan  And I say   Hey  go to Michigan   Sometimes they ll go south and that s okay  whatever  I want them in this country  But ideally I want to fill them up  We re doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies  Now you re back  You re back  So  you re back  Very proud of you  Very proud of you  But while we re creating jobs  fighting for Michigan workers  and achieving numbers that you ve never seen before  incredible victories for the American people are happening  The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage  You see what s going on  I ll tell you  these people are crazy  You ever hear   It s the economy  stupid   You know that was Clinton s saying  If you have a good economy  I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it  Nobody talks about it  If you re a Democrat  they say    Oh  it s the economy   If the economy s any good  And let me just tell you a little secret  If crooked Hillary would ve won  your economy would have crashed  You were going down  The regulations were taking it down  The taxes were taking it down  instead of being up     or whatever you re up  a lot  you would have been down  you would have been at less than half  It was crashing  For all those people that would say   Oh  it s the Obama   Let me tell you something  You were dying  And if you look at that first period of a couple of months  it was a disaster  but it was heading south  And as sure as you re standing  and I m sorry we couldn t get you seats  we didn t have any room  And by the way 20     people outside had to leave  You know  It s so cold outside we told them   Don t worry about a screen  go home  go home and watch   But we had  this is about a       seat arena  And I said to my people   Why so small   Are we spoiled  I watch these guys come in like Biden  he has a big rally and they get    people show up  No  it s true  I don t understand it  And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out  I m killing everybody  And they hate me  USA Today hates me  But there s a poll  we re beating everybody  But  so Biden has this rally  they ve got     seats  but only a small number of people  So you know what they do  They set up a round table  So think of these people  They come in  they think they re going to listen to the speech  they end up sitting on a round table discussing  They must ve been happy  right  We don t have enough room for round tables  I m sorry folks  No  they set up a round table but I think we re doing great  And how do you beat what we ve done  With the economy  with our great vets  with choice  You ve finally got choice  They ve been trying to get it for almost    years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  Four more years  And these people back here  Your seat or stand is better  Right  But you know what  They re going to be much more famous because the cameras can t see you  They can only see them  And the other thing  the cameras  do you ever notice  I go to these stadiums 25 30     people  They never show the crowd  You know why  Because they don t want to have  If crazy Pocahontas  if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever  She s in Manhattan  You got me  And people  I mean  I could have  I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and he d get a crowd that would be just as  He s     He d get a bigger crowd  But if she has the crowd   Oh  these crowds are so big   I ve had crowds over the last couple of weeks  We went to different Pennsylvania  Florida  But I mean thousands and thousands of people can t get into these NBA arenas  right  Big arenas  And we set records at everyone because we use the floor  Thank you  I appreciate it  But we use the floor  right  The basketball court  So we set records at every arena  They never even mention the crowds  They never mention the crowds  It s sort of amazing  You know what  I don t think we ve ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator  That s a long time ago  I don t think we ve ever had an empty seat  Now what the crooked media does though  if you got like over here  look how packed it is and there s thousands outside  but I   Please go home  You re going to catch pneumonia   But here s the thing  If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom  those cameras will turn to those two seats and they ll say  Trump wasn t able to fill up the arena   I always get nervous when I see some  I know they re coming back  Nobody ever leaves our speeches  Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally  But every time I see a man get up  I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they re getting up  The baby s going crazy and they re getting up  They re going to take it  But I know they re going to be right back  And I say   Fill those two seats  I don t want them to see it   Because they ll say   Couldn t fill up the arena   These are truly dishonest people  After three years of sinister witch hunts  hoaxes  scams  tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans  Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history  Was that the greatest  Remember when they all said  remember when they all said   No  no  You can t win Michigan  You can t   Then I went  I did one in Grand Rapids  right  Grand Rapids  We had        people that night  It was one o clock in the morning  That means it was Election Day when I started speaking  Hillary  Barack Obama  Michelle Obama  and Bill Clinton  they did an emergency trip  They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o clock  They got here at prime time  They started to speak  She had     people  I got here at one o clock in the morning the next day  which is now Election Day  How many people were there         people outside  inside  It was the last speech of Michigan  And they say   Well  sir  it s very hard to win Michigan   I said   Why would it be hard   Here s the beautiful thing  Everything I told you I ve done  but much more so  I said I was going to bring car companies back  I said I was going to bring in  I just hope you people know that  I just hope you know it  But I ll never forget that night  And in all fairness to Bill Clinton  he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office  I like him  I like him  But he told  you know the way they tried to shut him out  right  Because he s a pro  He s an instinct guy  right  He s instinct  He doesn t need  Right  Because he s a pro  He s an instinct guy  right  He s instinct  He doesn t need polling companies  Who the hell wants him  You know  if you want a polling company  pick up the newspaper  The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write  They write fake polls  It s true  they write fake polls  You call them suppression polls  You read them and you get depressed  because it looks like you re doing badly  They do that  I think it s almost worse than what they write  and you can t get much worse than what they write  So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary  his very dishonest wife  Crooked Hillary  Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary  He might  Maybe he just calls her crooked  He said   Crooked  I m telling you  Crooked  I don t like what I m seeing in Michigan  I don t like what I m seeing in Wisconsin   He said   I took the trip to Wisconsin and I ll tell you what  they had those Trump Pence signs all the way to the convention area  every lawn  every loan  I don t like Wisconsin   And then he said   Oh  don t worry about it   What the hell does he know  They told him   What do you know   Remember  they shut him out at the   They didn t want him talking  He was right  I mean  I don t want to cause any problems in the family  but he was right  But he talked about Wisconsin  Then he talked about Michigan  He said   Crooked  I m telling you  Crooked  I don t like what I m seeing in Michigan  I was in Michigan and I m telling you  they had those damn signs  I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn  and two of them on the car   And he said   You horrible human being  You d better start listening to me  because you re going to get your ass whooped  And you know what happened  You know what happened  She didn t listen  fortunately  And she didn t come to Michigan enough  And she didn t come to Wisconsin  I think at all  right  Because her polling data looked good  It looked good to me  too  Every time I went there with these crowds  So we won Wisconsin  We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel   where is Ronna  Where is Ronna  Ronna  she was so horrible  I didn t know her  Ronna McDaniel  and she was so aggressive  She kept calling and said   Could you please come out to Michigan   I said   Who the hell are you   And I said   What do you mean  another trip   So anyway  I made  we had these big crowds  I made it again  Then finally I said  two weeks out  I said   Ronna  no more  We re going to win it or we re not    Okay      in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids   Sir  could you come to Michigan tonight   And I thought  I was just about finished  I went to a last great state  and I said   It s over   Now I sit back and I watch  and let s see what happens  right  But she said   Could you come to Michigan   I said  that is the most aggressive human being I ve ever met  And we did it  And we won Michigan  And the word is that we re much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in      in Michigan  You better remember when you walk into   you know  it s November  rd this time  November  rd  By the way though  that evening  that incredible evening in November  one of the biggest nights in the history of television  You never hear them say it  so I might as well  That election   and my debates   you see their debates are dying  Who wants to watch Buttigieg  Buttigieg  Buttigieg  You know that you pronounce it they say   I heard some guy saying   No  no  because it s an unpronounceable name   That s why they call him Mayor Pete  right  Mayor Pete  Mayor Pete  Mayor Pete  I ve had you up to here  Mayor Pete  No  Buttigieg is leading  How does   no  you say it this way  You say it   they call him Mayor Pete  because nobody can pronounce his last name  That s the only   people think it says   by the way  you know what  I m not going to say bad things about him  You know why  I d love him to win  I thought I knocked off Pocahontas  I did it a year too early  a year too early  I give her credit  she then started to come back  I don t think she s going to make it though  She s gasping  She s gasping for air  But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg  and they said   Here s what you do  boot edge edge   Say   Edge  like the edge of a building  Edge edge  Buttigieg  Alfred E  Newman  You got to be older to know what that means  But congressional Democrats are directly attacking     million Michigan voters who rose up in       won the state  and now the Democrats are very upset  They want to get Michigan back  They just don t know how to do it  because they didn t do a thing for Michigan  They didn t do anything for Michigan  All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places  You know  I don t know if you know it  Mexico has     of your car business  You know that  right  Not because of me  They re not moving  But Mexico has       of our car business moved to Mexico  Can you believe this  Before I got there  but that s what I used to talk about  I said  when I was honored that night  I said  How do you let this happen  How do you let all these companies leave   It used to go    it s probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president  It might be the   and I had a lot of them  Immigration  I had a lot of them  but that may be the single biggest  With today s illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment  the do nothing Democrats  and they are do nothing   all they want to do is focus on this  what they could be doing   are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter  This lawless  partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party  Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks  It s crazy  It s crazy  You know why  Because people  we have an election right down the road  I announced three months ago that I m running  right  I ll give you a little clue  I announced because I figured once I announce  they d never impeach  nobody would be so stupid  But they d been trying to impeach me from day one  They ve been trying to impeach me from before I ran  okay  Because if you remember when I ran  I went immediately to number one  never came off number one  We had center stage from day one in the debates  So we had  I don t know 14     debates  We had a total of     actually  People forgot there was one that they never talk about it  but that s okay  But we had    people  and I was center stage  And I said   Wait a minute  this is no good   I want odd numbers  because of your center stage  if you have a    that means two people are in the middle  So I said   Make it    or make it nine  or I m not showing up   And generally they did it  because we were way ahead from the beginning  But I made a lot of great friends out of that group  and many of them are good friends today  Although you wouldn t know it based on the   they say that was the meanest   that was a pretty mean primary  you got to say  Wasn t that fun  I liked it  Through their depraved actions today  Crazy Nancy Pelosi s House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame  and it really is  It s a disgrace  Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president  They think that the Washington swamp  which we believe it or not  it ain t easy  because they got so much stacked  including these guys  You know what  These guys are apart of the Democrat Party  They are a part of it  You might as well call them Democrats  You know  it s owned by Commicast  They re just as bad as CNN  or they re just as bad as MSNBC  And by the way  CNN and MSNBC  their ratings are down the tubes  It s great  I love it  I love it  But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election  That s what they think  There s never been a time like this  Think of it  you have the greatest economy in the history of the world  Other countries come to see me  all of their leaders  and they say   Sir    first thing   Sir  congratulations on your economy  We re trying to do the same thing  Congratulations  sir   And these guys don t like talking about it  And if they do  they say   Obama did it  Oh  Obama  Obama   Remember Obama said   You will never be president  He will never be president   Then remember he said   I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president   And then I became president  He wasn t so happy  And in all fairness  he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary  because he had more strength  I mean  I go to these places  Secret Service  they take me  I haven t seen a lobby in three years  It s true  I go through basements  I pass compactor plants  I know more about compactors from this job  I don t see lobbies  I say  Fellows  you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby    No  sir   But I ll tell you what  I go upstairs  downstairs  all around  They re taking me up three flights  go down one  I said   Are we almost there    Yes  sir  another four flights   And I say   You think Hillary could do this  I don t think so   They d bring her back home  She wants to go to sleep  And now I hear she wants to run again  Wouldn t that be great  Oh  Thank you  Thank you  Oh would we love that  You think the Democrats are screwed up  Wait until that happens  Wouldn t that be   Oh  there s my guy  Lock her up  Lock her up  Lock her up  Well look  based on the FBI report  you just saw what happened with the IG  where they came out with the FBI  Based on that  you know what  I never stopped you  But now  think of what they did  Think of what they did  Think of how dishonest it all was  They shouldn t even be allowed to have an impeachment  because it was based on dishonesty  It was based on illegality  She went out  and they paid for a fake dossier  They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier  totally disproven  totally fake  The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign  And if we were Democrats  they would ve been in jail two years ago  It s a disgrace  Think of what they did  So they use this fake dossier  and they brought it before this big deal court  It s a big deal  the FISA Court  And they said this stuff  and they lied about it  because Comey  who s another beauty   did I do a great job when I fired his ass  What a great job  Oh no  they had bad plans  No  I did a great thing  That was like throwing a rock at a hornet s nest  Did that place explode  And then we learned about Lisa Page  and her wonderful lover  Peter Strzok  I love you Lisa  I love you more than anybody in the world  I love you more than anybody in the world  It causes problems with the wife  but we won t talk about that  Those tapes didn t work well  No  how about those statements  right  And then they say   In all fairness    I really liked the report  but how does the Inspector General say   because don t forget  he was appointed by Obama  So I m not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets  but we had a lot of those nuggets  How does the Inspector General say  You have these horrible   he s going to lose  Isn t he  He s going to lose  or she s going to win     million   Did you see all the zeros  It was like   I m blinking  I says   I think it s        He s going to lose     to one  Isn t he Peter  I love you so much  Peter  I ve never loved anyone like you  He s going to lose     million to one  Peter  right    That s right  He s going to lose     million to one   But there s no bias  How about the insurance policy  To me  the greatest  Just in case she loses  we have an insurance policy  We re in the insurance policy right now folks  We ve been in it for three years  that s what they meant  I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator  because we re doing awfully well  And I ll tell you something  Rush Limbaugh said it  Sean Hannity said it  Laura Ingram said it  Tucker said it  Ainsley said it  but a lot of people have said it  They said   There s nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened  and still created one of the greatest economies  and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years   I understand that  I understand that  but it s my life  very unfair to my family  I have to say this very  very unfair to my family  What they put my family through is a disgrace  Me  it s my life  It s fine  I do  But you know what  What they put my family through is a disgrace  and they ought to be ashamed  and we should get apologies all over the place  So yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party s outrageous abusive power  That s what it is  They have nothing  They re the ones that should be impeached  every one of them  I mean you got this guy  Schiff  He makes up a statement  and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity  and he makes up a statement from me that s totally fictitious  totally out of thin air  The worst statement I ve ever heard  Many people saw it  I had a person two weeks ago that said   I didn t love the statement you made  I said   Really  Didn t you read the transcripts   I always say   Read the transcript  But didn t you read it   No  no  I heard it on television  I watched Adam Schiff   He made it up  I then sent him the transcript  He said   Oh  now I feel better  That s perfect   I call it perfect  He called it perfect  Everyone calls it  if you read it  But here s the thing  He makes up this statement  and it finished  Didn t he have eight quid pro quos  Eight  Could you imagine  you re dealing with a country  and you say eight times that you ve got to do something  The first time they say   Well   The second time they say   That s strange   Third time they say   What s wrong   You said eight times  Eight times  They d have you arrested  They d have you put into an insane asylum  But he actually said   I think he said eight  not seven  eight  And then he finished with   Don t call me  I ll call you   Can you imagine  The President of the United States   Don t call me  I ll call you   You know what that is  That s a mafia statement  okay  That s the head of the mafia saying   Don t call me   This guy actually said that  and then he walked away and people became incensed  because they knew that wasn t the people that read the thing  Most people believed him  He s a liar  Because you know  he s a corrupt politician        No  he s a corrupt   and then I see him  By the way  you ever see this guy  He walks up to the mics  I mean  we re not   all fairness  look  I don t want to be   because with Me Too  I never even think about looks anymore  okay  I don t talk about looks of a male or a female  but in his case  let s just say   the last time I ll ever refer to this  He s not exactly the best looking guy we ve ever seen  No  any mic  He walks up to the mic  and he s so just   This is a sad  sad day for America  Our president is an employee of Russia  I have absolute proof that the president  this is at the beginning  and every week they d say  Where s the proof    It s coming  It s coming   Then we get the Mueller report  nothing  And I ll tell you what  I know some of the people in this audience  If I spent not     million  not    Trump haters  I call them the angry Democrats  It was     then it went to     and then Mueller  Did Muller do a good job  Did he do a good job  No  Boo  How was his performance in front of Congress  Boo  Not the best  but think of this      million they spent  And you know  I heard somebody say   Well  we got back some of that money   Let me tell you  you cost this country billions  and billions  and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn t get done  in all of the embarrassment to our country  You caused billions and billions of dollars  and it was a hoax  But this guy  Schiff   I have absolute proof  I have this  I have that  this  that   Anytime he sees a camera and he s stone faced  stone faced  He s a pathological liar  He gets up  and I ve never seen anything like it  Even I was saying   I wonder what he has  What does he have   He says   I have absolute  I said  I haven t spoken to Russia in year  What the hell do I have to do with Russia   But this guy gets up   oh  I think we have a vote coming in  Haleigh  Wow  Thank you  Haleigh  great job  Wow  The Republican party has never been so affronted  but they ve never been so united as they are right now  ever  never  And I know the senators  and they re great guys  and women too  We have some great women  We have great guys  They re great people  They love this country  They re going to do the right thing  They re going to do the right thing  So I said in my letter to Pelosi   I love that  You know  usually there s one  two  The Republicans  look  I ve said it for a long time  The Democrats are lousy politicians  they really are  They ve got horrible policies  open borders  crime is fine  drugs pouring through  I mean  think of what they do  Sanctuary cities  they love sanctuary cities  They re lousy politicians  but they have one thing   two things  They are vicious  They re the most vicious people  The Republicans aren t as vicious  They may learn to be vicious after going through this  though  But the other thing  the Democrats always stick together  Now think of it  three Democrats went over to our side  no Republicans  It s unheard of  And by the way  this is for a hundred years  I m not just talking about this little point in time  The Republicans are known as  it s always harder to stick together  These people are great  We have a great Republican Party  and we have to get that change  We have to take back the house  You ll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take   and by the way  we had another victory  The individual mandate  just a little while ago  it came over the wires  it was just upheld  The individual mandate is now gone  The most unpopular part of Obamacare  It was just upheld  So I said in my letter to Pelosi   By proceeding with your invalid impeachment  you re violating your oath of office  You re breaking your allegiance to the Constitution  You re declaring open war on American democracy  You dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme  yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America s founding  and your egregious conduct   And listen though  it s so true  it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged  and in fact their very lives to build   You are the ones interfering in America s elections  You are the one subverting America s democracy  We did nothing wrong  nothing whatsoever  This was just an excuse  You are the ones that are obstructing justice  You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish  personal  political and partisan gain   They re bringing pain  The work we could be doing on lowering drug prices  on getting rid of these horrible  horrible situations  You know in the border   the woman is okay  Is she okay  Okay  thank you very much  Thank you  I mean  some of these people are waiting here for three days  right  Thank you  They ll come back  Come back  Merry Christmas  Thank you  Merry Christmas is true  But what they ve done with this perversion  it s perversion  And when you watch some of these people get up and speak today  they don t even    You have violated the Constitution    Well  what does he done wrong    Well  we don t know that   They don t even have any crime  This is the first impeachment where there s no crime  I say   Tell me what I did  please    Well  we don t know  You violated the Constitution   You had Turley  who s smart  Alan Dershowitz  these guys  All of them  they said   There s no crime  There s no crime  right  There s no crime  There s no crime  I m the first person that ever get impeached  and there s no crime  I feel guilty  You know what they call it  Impeachment light  It s impeachment light  That s why  with Richard Nixon  I just see it as a very dark era  very dark  very   oh  you don t even like to think  I don t know about you  but I m having a good time  it s crazy  But I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party  we really do  Maybe I wouldn t feel the same way  but we have a great group of people behind us  We had in the House  and we have it in the Senate  They re doing a great job  so I m not worried  I m not worried  because it s always good when you don t do anything wrong  you get impeached  That may be a record that will last forever  But you know what they have done  They ve cheapened the impeachment process  And now anybody that become   this is a sacred position  Anybody that becomes president  I mean  they could have a phone call and they get impeached  So if the Republicans   if you had a Democrat as president  we have a Republican house  they don t like the guy for whatever reason  or the woman  they impeach the person  It s cheapened it  It s exactly what our founding fathers didn t want  and they said it could happen  and it s happened  But I know one thing  Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office  But it s so disappointing  I see a woman  Carolyn Maloney  She s a long time  nothing much  believe me  She s a Congresswoman from Manhattan  the east side  I was with her  Her first race  I helped her  She was always so nice  Oh  thank you  thank you   I made lots of contributions over the years  In New York  if you re not a   it s purely Democrat  especially in Manhattan  So what happens  I make lots of contributions for years  and years  and years  I go run  The first person I see  Carolyn Maloney  I raise my hand to impeach  Well  give me back the damn money that I ve been paying her for so many years  Let her pay me back all the money  Let her pay me back all the money  Then you have this Dingell  Dingell  you know Dingell  from Michigan  You know Dingell  You ever hear of her  Michigan  Debbie Dingell  that s a real beauty  So she calls me up like eight months ago  Her husband was here a long time  but I didn t give him the B treatment  I didn t give him the C or the D  I could ve  Nobody what is  you know  I gave the A  treatment   Take down the flags    While you re taking them down for ex Congressman Dingell     Oh  okay       do this  do that  do that  rotunda everything   I gave him everything  That s okay  I don t want anything for it  I don t need anything for anything  She calls me up   It s the nicest thing that s ever happened  Thank you so much  John would be so thrilled  He s looking down  He d be so thrilled  Thank you so much  sir   I said   That s okay  don t worry about it   Maybe he s looking up  I don t know  I don t know  Maybe  maybe  But let s assume he s looking down  But I gave him A   not A  not B   not B  I gave him the A   and she called me  She said   Oh  no   I won t go into the conversation  because it s not fair do that  But all I want to say is  let s put it this way  it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to     it was a     Okay  so that was what  February or something  Now they talk about this phony impeachment  and she s out there   Well  we have to look seriously at our president  because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States   Boo   And I can t be happy with that  because I love our country  I love this  and I love that   She loves everything  I said   She s a no  okay  No  but I look at her  and she s so sincere  and what happens  I vote to impeach Trump   And you know what  I didn t say   Who the hell knew this was even going to come up   I went through the whole Muller hoax  They did this big report  I was totally exonerated  They didn t even bring it up at the impeachment  because I was totally exonerated  If they saw one little kernel  one little quarter of a sentence   look what they did with one word  Remember this  what did I do  Why did I do  It s us  But they don t say it that way  They say   I   They read it totally different  schiff and his band of thieves  they read it  Now I say basically  very simple  do us a favor  our country  Do us  Do us  Not me  Our country  And then what do I say  I say   The United States Attorney General  Attorney General of the United States could speak to you  it would be great  okay  Because it s known for major corruption  In fact  the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction   on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty  and everything that was going on in Ukraine  right  He looked for it  that s how he got into office  He got into office that way  So we take it and they repeat it a thousand times  and they never say with the right   so I go wild  and we start  And the Republicans have got it right  Now we always correct him  but I use the word us  Us is the United States  our country  And then it actually says  I think  Comma  country  but they don t say that  They say  Do me a favor   How many times have you heard it  Where they say in a speech   And then the president said  do me a favor   Well  that s not what I said  I said   Do us a favor  our country   And then I said  the Attorney General of the United States  I didn t say my campaign  I said the Attorney General of the United States  I didn t say my campaign manager  Okay  I said the attorney   And these people want to impeach the President of the United States for that  Oh  and then what happened  Right  Then what happened  So then  the President of Ukraine  who s a quality person  said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  That was a killer for the Democrats  right  Then his foreign minister said the same thing  He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  There was no pressure  That s a killer  So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago  They tried to say that he s not a strong person  that he was weak  They used the word weak  that he was weak  and under the power of Trump  he said  Do you know how insulting that is  Anybody that becomes president of a country  and that s a big country and it s a tough country  you got to be tough  He s tough  But so what they re saying now is he was weak because the wording  it just doesn t fit  Okay  These are really dishonest people  And if the press was fair  this thing never would have happened  So the House Democrats are surrendering their majority  their dignity  their reputations  They look like a bunch of fools  And I ll tell you  we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party  I could read off a list of    names  But they re giving up their honor  and they ll receive a big backlash at the box office  When you take a look  that ballot box  that ballot box on November  rd  I think we re going to have crowds like we ve never had  And I ll tell you something  it used to be  they d always say   Oh  the Republicans   You know  in       I didn t run  I didn t run  right  They all said   Oh  we didn t   Well actually  we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about  We just approved     federal court justices      federal justices  including courts of appeal       We ll be up  probably by the end of the year  to      and for that  I thank President Obama  He gave me     openings  He gave me      I said to him  my people  I got there  because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court  We have two great Supreme Court judges  Right  Two Justices of the Supreme court  Kavanaugh  Gorsuch  Two great men  They re great  And how about the pain that they put Justice Kavanaugh through  right  Over a phony deal  I hate to tell you  Over a phony deal  What a disgrace  what they put that man through and that family through  Just remember it come November  You got to remember  it s a long time  You know  in the life of Trump     months is an eternity  It s a long time  Somebody said   Congratulations sir  you re going to win   I said   Don t say that  Just don t talk about it  Let s always pretend you re one point down   Like last time  Going to be close  Nope  it s going to be close  But what they put that man through was horrible  what they put his family through was horrible  And you know  those stories largely have been recanted  And frankly  the ones that didn t recant  I don t know what a Supreme Court judge does  but he should sue them  He should sue them  So we want to take back the House  we ll hold the Senate  and we ll keep the White House  You will have the greatest healthcare  You will continue with the greatest judges  You know  we have judges that are   We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal  I have to be always very truthful  because if I m a little bit off  they call me a liar  They ll say   He gets a Pinocchio  the stupid Washington Post  they have Pinocchio  I mean  even if you re saying things perfectly  it s a Pinocchio  There s nothing you can say where you don t get a Pinocchio  But what happens  what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story  They said  Whether you like him or not  the job he s done on judges and Supreme Court Justices  but the job he s done on judges is amazing  Say it s the most important thing  See  I don t agree  I say defense is the most  the military is the most  But once you re beyond the military  I mean to me defense is the most important  Because without good defense  maybe we don t need judges so much  right  It s like somebody said   Well  we violated the budget   I said   Do me a favor  don t worry about the budget  If we re attacked and aren t doing very well and somebody says   Well  at least we have a good budget   that doesn t work too well   Right  That doesn t work  So we have great military  we have great judges  we have great everything  Drug prices down  For the first time in    years  drug prices came down  And that was with no help from the Democrats  If they helped  because you need their votes  if they helped  I could get those drug prices down    and      Okay  And we just approved  and we re approving very soon for the Governor of Florida  Ron DeSantis  where he can buy  he has the right to go  we re giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country  where the prices for the identical drug  identical drug are     less  He s going to do that for the people of Florida  And we re going to do that for your governors if they want to do that  We ll get that down so far  Everyone in America can see straight through the Washington Democrats  phony  dangerous charade  Schiff makes up so many things  Pelosi makes it up  and she backs him up  I saw her on a television show  and George Stephanopoulos  that s another beauty  he said  even he said  he was defending me  I couldn t believe it  He made this statement   But you know he lied on that  He made up this stuff    No  he didn t  he didn t   So that means Nancy Pelosi said no  the statement that he made up  But it s all going to end soon  and it s going to come out to a beautiful  great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation  Thank you very much  So that s it  We have the greatest country  We ve turned around a ship  We need four more years  If we don t have it   Now  if you want to drive them crazy  we had one group in Pennsylvania  some guy started screaming       more years       They went crazy  And you know what they don t understand  When I do get out  they re all going to go out of business  They re making more money than they ve ever made  That crazy New York Times  one of the worst newspapers in the world  one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world  totally phony  They came out with a story  where it was a great headline for me  and the people that read it  the super radical left  they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story  Can you believe it  No  they re among the most dishonest people  But I ll never forget  before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady   Our First Lady is doing a great job  great job  I said   First Lady  you re so lucky I took you on this journey  this wonderful  beautiful journey   And it is  You know why it s a wonderful  beautiful journey  Because look at  what we re accomplishing is unbelievable  It s unprecedented  It is unprecedented what we re accomplishing   You re so lucky  I said it to all my people  I have great people in the back  I say  You folks are so lucky I took you on this  You could be home right now  relaxing   But I d rather be here  frankly  than any place  These rallies are great  They re inspiring  You are inspiring  And you know  it s funny  we re not even into election season  Yeah  it s a long way away  We re not even in it  And yet  I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the      election  Does that make any sense  I think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt  A lot of it has to do with the phony  witch hunt because you re smart people  You re the elite  They re not the elite  You re the elite  You re the elite  You do better than they do  They talk about it  don t you hate it   Well  the elite     Oh really  I went to better schools  Many of you went to better schools  We won t talk about homes  even though your homes are nicer  We won t talk about jobs  You see the jobs reports  You see what s happening  Do you see where wages are going up  You know  when I first started  when I was here  one of my first speeches  I was talking that people made more money  that was four years ago  so it was    years before that  so that s        years ago  They made more money    years ago than they were making when I got elected president  And they worked one job versus two or three jobs  Now it s going up beautifully and we want that  the salaries  And you know  the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker  It s percentage  the best  The blue collar worker  They had two and three jobs  The blue collar worker is going up the most  Anyway  so you know what else  The thing I m happiest about  African American unemployment  the lowest in the history of our country  African American  Remember I used to say  you remember  look at  you  Are you the greatest guy  Everyone thinks  do I pay  I m telling you  I have a group of African American guys  and gals by the way  that follow me around and they think I pay them  and I don t  I love them  they love me  They come  How many rallies have you come to  A lot  They re great people  just great  Thank you  I don t even know who the hell he is  Is that right  I don t know him  but I like him  I see him at so many rallies  I appreciate it  You and your group  they re great people  Thank you  So you re obviously doing well if you can travel around like that  right  Ah  he knows  I appreciate it  I really do  I think it s fantastic  Thank you  Thank you  But think of this  African American unemployment is the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country  Their poverty levels  they had a horrible poverty level  in the negative sense  now their poverty levels are the best they ve ever been in the history of our country  Same with Hispanic Americans  the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers  And the same with Asians  the best unemployment  And women  I m sorry     years  best in    years  I ve let the women down  But I think within another couple of months  you ll be historical  So only    years best  The best in    years  But what we re doing has been an incredible thing  It s an incredible thing  When I m on the debate stage with one of these characters  and they try and say negative stuff  I ll just say   Well  here s the story  In the history of our country  this group is doing the best  and that group is doing the best  and the women are doing the best  and everybody s doing  And frankly  you know what it is  The whole country s doing the best  Okay  The whole country is doing the best   So we have records and everything  and yet they re trying to  and they really are  I ve never seen anything like it  they re accusing me  really  of doing what Joe Biden   Biden admitted what he did  How about this  They protect him  Did you see the crummy debate  Those debates are so boring  They re dying in the ratings  They re dying  they re dying    While it s totally unsupported   What s unsupported  He s on tape saying that he s holding back    billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor  How about that question  I won t say who answered  because you know I m not  I actually used to like the guy  he was a nice guy to me  but now I don t like him so much  but that s okay  But he goes   While it s totally unsubstantiated  and while we beg your mercy that we re asking you even to bring up this question  but President Trump said you refused to give    billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son s company   And Sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer  and that s the end of it  That s it  Then whenever I bring it up  do you ever notice they always use    While these charges are totally unsubstantiated   He s on tape  If that were me  it s the electric chair  They would bring the electric chair back  No  the guy s on tape  and they always say it s unsubstantiated   It is not supported by fact  one of them the other day  they finally changed the word  It is supported by fact   No  it s supported by tape  No  it s unbelievable  In many ways  I d like to have him win because number one  he s going to have to eventually answer that question  and number   She said he doesn t know where he is  That s the other problem  Now  I ve been doing this for a long time  and I have much bigger crowds than anybody s ever had in history  By the way  do you know what  I say it against the fake news  because you know what they re going to say  Every stadium is packed  I give my people one instruction  get the largest stadium you can get  Now  that s why I was a little surprised  But in Battle Creek  you don t have that many  right  Not too many stadiums  But I wanted to be here  You know why I wanted to be here  First of all the crowd is incredible  The crowd outside  But let me tell you  No  you know why I wanted to be here  Because we have a lot of choices  but I wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly  and I said   I want to be there   Pretty simple  pretty simple  Pretty simple  I wanted to be here for that reason  and I just want to say thank you  because I ll tell you what  you came in   I don t know  I didn t get       but we got a damn good percentage  right  We got a damn good percentage  So it s really thrilling to be here  But we re joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders  Your Michigan House Speaker  Lee Chatfield  Where s Lee  Lee  come up if you want  Come on  what the hell  we have nothing else to do  Should we get him up  Yes  Come up Lee  come up Lee  get up here  Come on up  Lee  Republican Party Chairwoman  Ronna McDaniel  who I spoke to  And the bottom line on the end of her story  so when I won I said   Who s going to head up the RNC   I said   I got to get that woman from Michigan   Remember they were all saying   You can t win Michigan   Now we re going to win it by so much  you better remember all those  Every time a car plant opens  please think about Trump  Come on up here  Lee  Michigan GOP Chairwoman  Laura Cox  Thank you  Hate to tell you  but all your congressmen  you know where they are right now  Your congressmen  all of your Congresspeople  men  wonderful people  they re at a place called Congress right now  They re doing an unbelievable job of supporting your President and supporting you  They had a choice   Sir  should we leave and be there   I said   Don t leave  Stay right where you are   That s why we got that vote  That s some vote  right Lee  The Chairman of the Woman s Workers and Workers for Trump  and a proud union autoworker  Terry Bowman  who s been so terrific  Thank you  Terry  Come on up  And while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment  we re focused on jobs  jobs  jobs  This group  local leaders  And all your Washington folks  they are right where they have to be in Washington tonight  Thank you  Thank you  Great job  Thank you very much  We ve eliminated more job killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country  whether it s four years or eight years  or in one case  much more than eight years  In a period of two and a half years  we have eliminated more regulations than any other president  by far  You re saving almost        a year because of regulation cuts  Total income gains for median households will reach         a family  I ll give you a couple of quick numbers  So under President Bush  for eight years  you saved       meaning you took in     bucks  Okay  fine  Under President Obama  you took in       Under President Trump  including the energy savings  and the regulation savings  and the tax cut savings  it s more than         in less than three years  Pretty good  right  So for two eight years  you had a     450  and a      That s eight years       In less than three years  you had more than          That goes right into your pockets  It s one of the reasons our economy is doing well  because  as they say  the consumer is doing better than they ve ever done  And that s great  that s what we wanted  We ve ended the war on American energy  and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth  And these maniacs want to close it up  How about going to Texas  You know Beto  What  Remember what he said  I said   Oh  this guy s a loser  You know a salesman  like if you re a great salesman  you never talk that you re a great salesman  You don t walk in and say   Well  I m a great salesman  I can sell     Any guy that does that  they re no good  It s those quiet type that get you  You know  the ones that don t talk  So Beto  when he first got in  remember this clown  He gets in  no  no  he gets in   I was made for this job  to run for president   After about two weeks  they killed him  He was gone  But you remember  he was against the Bible  he was against religion  he was against guns  and he was against oil and gas  And he comes from Texas  I said  that s a platform  Think of it  He s against religion  he s against guns  and against oil and gas  Think of it  I don t like to bring it up because he s gone zone  but he comes from Texas  I said   Abraham Lincoln can t win in Texas with that platform   But they are  all of them  they want to close up your energy  It s a big deal  They want to close up your steel mills  They don t want your steel mills  Look at what I ve done for steel  I mean  the steel is back  We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places  and your steel mills that are doing great  they re expanding all over the country  And they were going to be out of business within two years  The way they were going  they were gone  United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions  Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U S  auto industry forever  And you know why  Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric  I want to have an alternative  a big alternative  You re going to always have the alternative  And a lot of people don t know of the electric can ever catch the gas  you know  And by the way  there ll be different forms of energy coming along  But they want to close them up  and we re not closing them up  We re going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing  you can have it for a lot of different reasons  We re even bringing back the old light bulb  You heard about that  right  The old light bulb  which is better  I say   Why do I always look so orange   You know why  Because of the new light  they re terrible  You look terrible  They cost you many  many times more  like four or five times more  And you know they re considered hazardous waste  When a light bulb is out  you ve got to bring it to a dump  So let s say  over here in Battle Creek  where s your nearest dump  Okay  that s what  a couple of hundred miles away  So every time you lose   drive a couple of hundred miles  right  I said   How many people do that   Nobody  What do they do  They throw it in the garbage  But you know what it is  because it s all gas  It s much more expensive  four or five times more  And I came into office  I did a lot of this  Sinks  showers  all of this stuff  I did a lot of it  No water comes out  You have areas where there s so much water  you don t know what to do with it  You turn on the shower  you re not allowed to have any water anymore  I mean  we do a lot of it  Dishwashers  we did the dishwasher  right  You press it  Remember the dishwasher  you d press it  boom  there d be like an explosion  five minutes later you open it up  the steam pours out  the dishes  Now you press it    times  the women tell me   Again   You know  they give you four drops of water  and they re in places where there s so much water  they don t know what to do with it  So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers  We re going back to the old  By the way  by the time they press it    times  you spend more on water  and electric  Don t forget  the whole thing is worse because you re spending all that money on electric  So we re bringing back standards that are great  and better machinery that you can have the water again  right  But with the light bulb  I said   What s going on with the light bulbs  A lot of people are complaining about the cost   So I had a couple of experts come in  I said   Tell me  what gives a better light    Well  we liked the old light bulb better   I said   I like it better   And so what I did is you can have either one  If you want to buy the newer kind  you can  And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind  like I do  So we re bringing back the old light bulb  So it s a much less expensive  it probably gives a better light  But whatever it is  and you ll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb  I mean  it sounds like little  but it s big stuff  Okay  It s big stuff  and we re doing it with a lot of other things  our dishwashers  And you know  I won t tell you one of the things  because every time I tell you  they do a big number on it  You know the one I m talking about  right  Sinks  right  Showers  And what goes with a sink and a shower     times  right     times  Not me  of course  not me  but you  him  But I never mention that  because one time I mentioned all three  I said   Sinks  showers  and toilets   The headline was   Trump with the toilets  toilets   That s all they want  They don t even mention it  So I didn t mention that  okay  I go off the record  But you know what  It s terrible  You want to wash your hands  you turn on the sink  no water comes out  So you leave the water going    times as long  it s the same thing  You have a shower  drip  It s no good for me  For me  You know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business  They always used to say I wore a hairpiece  It s okay  I know people wear hairpieces  But they always used to say  They don t say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms  If you wear one of those suckers  you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you  You look handsome  don t worry about it  But in the last two decades before my election  we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country  The people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they ve wanted to do for so many years  And that s why it doesn t work  We look so forward to taking it on  and it is all about cleaning the swamp  draining the swamp  and we have a very  very big  bad  dangerous swamp  Okay  that s enough of that  That s enough  So among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the U S  auto industry  I withdrew from the horrible Trans Pacific Partnership  That would have ended your auto industry  A lot of people don t know that  but I do  Remember TPP  We were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off  The people that made these trade deals  it s like  where do they come  Like the one in Korea  that was a Hillary Clinton special  She said   This will produce         new jobs   And I said   Well  what happened   He said   Well  she was right   Except it was for South Korea  not for us  No  it s true  It produced         jobs for South Korea  These deals were so bad  But now they re getting really good  and some of them are getting great  and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal  Wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time  But we have to go through a little pain  because we have to do it  and then they all say   We re going to withdraw  and then I say  You can withdraw  I don t care  We re putting tariffs on your country   Then they say   We d love to make a deal  sir   The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong  Since the election  we ve created        brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs  manufacturing jobs  Remember the statement by President Obama   You d have to wave a magic wand   Remember the magic wand  Because manufacturing   And I said   You know  that sounds strange  What do you do if you don t have manufacturing  How do you make things   Right  Manufacturing jobs won t happen  Well  we ve got         manufacturing jobs  and you re going to see a big  big increase  The truth is  we need more people  You know what  We need more people  We need more people coming into the country  and they re going to come in  and they re going to come in through merit  and they re going to love our country  and they re going to respect our country  and they re going to work  We do need more people  They re opening these massive  Foxconn in Wisconsin  they re opening these massive plants and it s hard to get people  We want people coming in  but they have to come in  only they have to come in through merit  Fiat Chrysler recently announced a      billion investment in Michigan  including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation  And General Motors recently announced a      million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant right here in Michigan  Come on  General Motors  let s go  General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building  I wasn t happy about that  That was the only building I had a problem within the whole car industry  right  Right  You know the one I m talking about  I didn t like that  Anyway  but they re spending money  you know  what can I tell you  But these companies are coming in  a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to  I say   You have to  or we re not trading with you anymore   Because we had such big deficits with these countries  With Japan  we had a     billion deficit  I said  Shinzo  he s great Prime Minister of Japan  But he said   But nobody has ever asked us to do this   I said   I m asking you   They are building many  many plants  They re building many plants now in the United States  the Japanese  And after years of rebuilding foreign nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  Is that okay  We were surrounded with globalists  You know  they think it s okay  You open a plant in some country that you never heard of  they make your product  they send it  In the meantime  they close all their factories here  We re not doing that anymore  Those are globalists  They think it s wonderful to have deficits  I don t  They think it s great  It s a great thing to have deficits  No  those are globalists  The globalists are passe   our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you  the American people  before anybody else  We must care for our own  We must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans  I don t even know what s happening  It s terrible  And we ve moved out thousands and thousands of MS   thugs out of our country  And we have agreements now with Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador  They didn t use to take them back  If we had a murderer  then we should get them the hell out  We don t really want them in our prisons and take care of them for        years  We want to bring them back  They wouldn t take them  The planes used to go around and around  don t land  don t land  With us  they land  We worked out deals with every one of them  We stopped giving them all the aid  We re giving them all this money and then they said   We re not going to let you land  We re not going to let you take them back   I said   That s okay      million  we were giving them  I said  now we give them    we give them nothing  All of a sudden they said   We would love to have them back   We would love it  It s wonderful to have them back  In June  two illegal aliens in Sandusky  Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife  Then  they hid her body in a water drain  A criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death  a single mother of five young children  It s happening all the time  Far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities  which deliberately release dangerous  violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets  We had a great election in North Carolina recently  two great congressmen got elected  you don t hear about it  when they win  you don t ever hear about it  just a few months ago  Two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I went in and said   Talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities  and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities  Soon as I mentioned that  boom  they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great  Great thing  The sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you  the people of California  they don t like sanctuary cities either  They re stuck with them because they have crazy politicians  Earlier this year  authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County  Michigan  anybody know Kent County  Released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle  They let him go to roam free in Michigan communities  If you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan  if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens  if you want to have a safe life  frankly  it s so crazy what they re doing  You wouldn t even believe it  You have only one choice in       you must vote Republican  Thank you  I m surprised  As you know  you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan  I was almost surprised to hear it  but you have them  It s one of those progressive things  They think they re doing a wonderful favor for the world  And now we re getting these prosecutors that  you murder somebody  they give you two months  they fight that you don t even have to go to jail  What s going on is crazy  Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  illegal crossings are down     since may and we ve ended catch and release  We ve ended it  We could ve ended it so easily  It s called the loophole  You catch him and then you release him into a country  That s what you had to do by law  And if you don t do that  they arrest the border patrol people  You believe this  The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people  These are the people because look  when you have a caravan of eight or        people  a lot of those people  do you think that Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador  do you think they re sending us their finest  I don t think so  Alright  How about the lottery  That was a Schumer deal  Chuck Schumer  crying Chuck  crying Chuck Schumer  I used to be a big contributor to him  he used to kiss my ass  Chuck Schumer  He d do anything  He would ve done anything for me  Anything I asked him  get Schumer on the phone   You do this  you do that  You get him on the phone  that son of a bitch   He would have done  I didn t need anything  but he would have done anything  Now it s like   The prisoner has not acted    Give me a break  Give me a break  Find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck  give all that money back please  Carolyn Maloney  give that money back  Every penny should come back  They act so pompous  They act so righteous  They re not righteous  They re not righteous  They re bad people  The far left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now  Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor      million people are going to lose  A lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that s phenomenal  And that s what you want  They want to take it away       They want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night  I don t think so  Not in this group  And you know what  Some people  it s good so people  but can you imagine  They want to take away     million people  great  private  highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor  Remember Obama     times   You can have your doctor  you can have your plan   Didn t work out that way  did it  I think we should impeach him for that  Let s impeach him  for that  for the IRS scandal  for the guns  Remember the guns  he was giving them to anybody that wanted them  He gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn t have them registered  right  Not to good  Impeach him  Why didn t the Republicans impeach him  Those were really  how about giving around      billion in cash  How about that  By the way  I ended the Iran nuclear deal  I hope you happy  much different country  But how about giving Iran      billion in cash  Many big planes going over to Iran  loaded up to the ceiling with cash  You know what      billion  you ever see like at a casino     million wrapped up  It s a big pile of stuff  that s a million  Now multiply it       billion in cash he gave  So  why is he allow to do that  Did anybody try to impeach him for that  Everybody knew it was wrong  Republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians  Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother s womb  right up until the moment of birth  Right  That is why I ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God  Democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  And that s what it is  The Republican party is the party of the American worker  the American family  and the American dream  And that s really what it is  We re also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln  A lot of people forget that  but we have to bring it up  To protect the health and safety of our citizens  we awarded      million to improve water infrastructure in Flint  How badly was Flint  Who were the geniuses that did that to you  You have clean water coming into Flint  They had to pay a very tiny little fee  So instead  they go into this horrible  horrible  really polluted water and the water comes out of there  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks  and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people  It hurt the people  But we re getting it fixed  And I know your previous governor was a Republican  but I was not a big fan of his  I was not  but I m not a big fan of the one that can t fix the potholes either  We re committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth  and that s what it s about  It s about clean air and it s about clean  beautiful water  And it s about keeping our industry  not closing it because of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord  How s Paris doing  I don t think too well  How s Paris doing with the yellow vests  The yellow vests  You know why  Because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in France never heard of  It s not working out too well  We re lowering prices  We re lowering taxes  We re making it possible  I mean  look at gas prices now  Look at gas prices  I recognize Israel s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem  And we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Big deal  For years  you watched as your politicians apologized  Member   I would like to apologize  I would like to apologize   Nah  we don t apologize  Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan  You re getting your auto industry back  At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation  If you want your children to grow up  a land of safety  it s really  we want a land of safety  justice  Well  I don t know  When I look at those FBI reports we got out  we got to clean up a lot  What they ve done to hurt people  what they ve done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people  what they ve done to hurt people  I think one of the best things I did as president  a lot of people would say   With all what we ve done for the economy and  but one of the best things is firing James Comey s ass out of there  Boy  those reports are kept  Did you see the other day  Well  ah  ah   First time now he said  in other words  he s     there folks  He s hit the golden pond  Anyway  so what we re doing is  we re doing things that are going to make our victory  it s like a tree  We need that extra four years  We ve done so much  even Right to Try  You know Right to Try  People were traveling  they re terminally ill  they re traveling all over the world  We have the best medical in the world  the best doctors  the best labs  best hospital  They re traveling all over the world  to try and get  because it takes years to get something approved  And I said   Wait a minute folks  why aren t we doing this   And they ve been trying to do it for    years  They couldn t get it done  Not that easy  The drug companies didn t want the liability  the country didn t want the liability  the insurance companies didn t want the liability  I said   Here s what we do  We ll sign an agreement with the people where you re exculpated from all liability    Huh  That s a good idea   And it s a very strong agreement so we can t get sued  But I said   Listen  they were worried they re going to hurt people   I said   These people are terminally ill  They re terminally ill  and so we do it now   Nine months ago  all the legislators at the    years  so if somebody s sick  they don t have to go to Asia  they re have to go to Europe  Or if you re poor  you go home and you die  Now what happens  Very simple  You sign that document  they work it out  You wouldn t believe how many lives are being saved  It s incredible  It s incredible  I m very proud of it  Right to Try  I hope you don t need it  You don t want it  You don t want it  Okay  But if you do  it s there  With your help  we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  We will enact the greatest trade deals ever made  They ll result in more products  proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  made in the USA  We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  What we re doing is unbelievable  We re so far ahead of everybody  What we ve done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of what we re doing  it would take    13     years to get things approved  It s down to a much smaller number  but we re finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America  We ve started the process  Who would ve thought that  In    years  it s a    year process  we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been been started before I came to office  It was just wasted time  We will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  Above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America  We support  protect and defend the constitution of the United States  We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  They re incredible  and that includes ICE  You know how tough these people are  These are great patriots  They love our country  Even the sheriffs alone for  some of the people that they re dealing with  These guys walk into the golem s nest and in some cases they just swing it out  They can have it  They love it  These are great  If we didn t have them  and I told you before  they re taking out bad  bad  bad people by the thousands  especially MS   gang members  Who s going to do that  Who s going to do that  Anybody in the front row  I don t know  What about you  You re a tough guy  You might do it  You could do it  I don t know  You might  yeah  you can  What you like  We re going to recruit you  I think you could handle yourself  Now  these are tough people  right  You got to be tough  Then they get accused  they re too tough  Oh  they re too tough  You have some of these guys  They knife people  They don t even need a gun because it s more painful  They knife the two young girls     years old  Beautiful  They cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them  These are animals  And then Nancy Pelosi said  I shouldn t use the term animal  And by the way  she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the Pacific ocean and into their beaches  She ought to go and take care of her district in San  Do you see what s going on  And it rains and it s filth and it s needles and it s drugs and it s  you know what  It s everything and it goes right into those storm sewers  Storm  not sanitary  storm and it goes right out into the Pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine Los Angeles and San Francisco  but we ve just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they re doing  And Nancy Pelosi is playing games  She ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything  San Francisco was the most beautiful city  When you look at what s happened with the tents all over the place  where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat  they re getting sick  Diseases are coming back that this world hasn t seen for    40     years  It s a disgrace  She ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense  We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  We believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy are the true American way  We believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great American flag  And we live by the words of our national motto and it s always going to be up there  They want to take everything down  They don t want Thomas Jefferson anymore  They don t want anything  That s a terrible thing and we fight for it  now  We fight  These words will never be taken off  I don t care where I am  If I m up there  if I m down here  I don t know  but we ll be fighting  We ll never take these words off  in God we trust  We stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood  sweat and tears for this beloved nation  This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line  It s the place where General Motors  Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation  It gave us Motown  the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest  This is the American mid west  And Michigan is the state where generations of strong  tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world  And we are making it bigger  better and stronger than ever before  by far  Loyal citizens like you help build this country  And together  we are taking back our country  We are returning power to you  The American people  the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted  but with us  you will never be forgotten again  The forgotten men and women of this country will never  ever be forgotten again  And I m fighting for you  And I love doing it with everything that I have  And I will never  ever stop  And you know that  I will say I could have a much easier life  Some people say   Why is he doing it   You know why I m doing it because we re doing the thing and look what we re doing is we re bringing back our country again  We re respected again  we re respected again  We are so respected  you don t even know how respected  I went to NATO where we were being ripped off because the other countries  you have    countries  and the other countries weren t paying their bills  They were delinquent in real estate  I noticed people are using that word  I ve been using it for the last year  It s like a real estate trend  That s when they don t pay their rent  right  Well  they weren t paying and you have to see this chart  until I got there  They got to pay and they said   Well  does that mean you won t protect us   I said   You don t want the answer to that question   Over the last  and the Secretary General Stoltenberg  over the last period of just two years  I raised  not from us  nothing from us       billion  but that s nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying      billion more  All of those countries  My biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO  He says   I never thought this could   I m telling you  if you look  it s like    years just down  President Obama would go there  make a speech   I d like to thank everybody for being here  Thanks  Look  great job  Sayonara  Goodbye   Bush  they all did  Nobody ever asked for money  We were spending for      of NATO  We re protecting Europe  They rip us off on trade  right  They rip us off like crazy  We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade  We re changing that  but it s a long time  It s been going on a long time  They don t take your product  They don t take your cars  They don t take your farm product  They don t take your medical machines  We do a big business  They sell us  We don t sell them because they put restrictions  We have better equipment than them  but they make it so that our equipment doesn t qualify  It s called artificial barriers or non monetary barriers  It s brutal what they do  I m telling you  they re as bad as China  just smaller  They are as bad as China  just smaller and now China s doing great  We re very happy  but we have to do something with that  We have to take care of our people  We can t be ripped off by these countries  so NATO is ripping us off militarily  but now they re starting to pay big money and that s good  We want to help them  We want to be there with them  but they have to pay  They have to pay       billion and the fake news doesn t even want to talk about it  They don t want to talk about it  They talk about other things  They don t want to talk about that  When you d get a chance though  just a couple of weeks  maybe you could say over a short period of time  NATO countries will be paying      billion more  More  not total  More  How s that  Good  That s not too bad  Nobody else could do that  I guarantee  I won t tell you what took place in those closed door meetings  Some of them don t like me  They like Obama  Germany likes Obama  A lot of these countries  France  they like Obama  It s embarrassing  In France  President Obama is more popular than President Trump  Well  I should be  I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they re ripping us off on the internet  Okay  If I ever become more popular  that means I m not doing my job  You should say he s out  It s true  I could be loved in Germany  I could be loved in Germany  Oh  they d love me  My father came from Germany  parents and I could be loved in Germany  They d like me so much  but then I m not doing my job for you  Have to do it  Have to do it  With your help  your devotion  your drive  we re going to keep on working  We re going to keep on fighting  We are going to keep on winning  winning  winning because we are one movement  one people  one family and one glorious nation  under God  America is thriving like never before  And ladies and gentlemen of Michigan  the best is yet to come  Great state  Great state  You better remember all those jobs in a year from now  I tell you  I ll say   That state let me down   I don t think that s going to happen  I m hearing very good thing  You know the interesting thing  before it was like a promise  I said I m going to bring car back  I m going to bring this  I m going to be pres  it was all like  it s good  You believed me  I was successful  all this  but now we ve done it  We have done more than I promised  no politics  I promised  we ve done more than we promised  No politician I think  has ever done that  Together we will make America wealthy again  We will make America strong again  We will make America proud again  We will make America safe again and we will make America great again  Thank you  Thank you  Michigan  Thank you '"
