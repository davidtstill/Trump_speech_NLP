## Performing Sentiment Analysis on Trump Campaign Speeches

Kaggle provides a number of great datasets. I found someone that posted 35 of Trump's campaign speeches in 2019 and 2020. Given how close the election was and how divisive Trump is considered by many, I thought it would be timely to perform NLP and sentiment analysis on the speeches.

## Steps Taken to Perform the Analysis
The Kaggle dataset provided 35 text documents with each text document containing one speech that Trump gave across various cities in the U.S.

I read in the the individual speeches, converting each speech into one large, concatenated string, and stored them into a DataFrame:

## Conclusion:

The speeches were largely rated as "neutral"
