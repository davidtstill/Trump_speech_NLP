## Performing Sentiment Analysis on Trump Campaign Speeches

Kaggle provides a number of great datasets. I found someone that posted 35 of Trump's campaign speeches. Given how close the election was and how divisive Trump is considered by many, I thought it would be timely to perform NLP and sentiment analysis on the speeches. 

## Conclusion:

The speeches were largely rated as "neutral"
